# R151 FILENAME FIX REPORT
Date: 2025-09-05 21:52 UTC
Fixed by: software-factory-manager

## ISSUE SUMMARY
Orchestrators were unable to read mandatory R151 rule due to incorrect filename reference.

## ROOT CAUSE
- **Incorrect reference**: `R151-parallel-agent-timestamp.md`
- **Actual filename**: `R151-parallel-agent-spawning-timing.md`
- **Location**: `/agent-states/orchestrator/FIX_BUILD_ISSUES/rules.md` (line 94)

## INVESTIGATION RESULTS

### Files Checked
1. **Rule Library**: Confirmed R151-parallel-agent-spawning-timing.md exists (17016 bytes)
2. **Agent States**: Found 1 incorrect reference in FIX_BUILD_ISSUES state
3. **Bootstrap Files**: All references use R151 number only (no filename)
4. **Command Files**: All references use R151 number only (no filename)

### Correct References Found
- 20+ correct references to `R151-parallel-agent-spawning-timing.md` across:
  - SPAWN_CODE_REVIEWERS_EFFORT_PLANNING state
  - ANALYZE_IMPLEMENTATION_PARALLELIZATION state
  - SPAWN_AGENTS state
  - ANALYZE_CODE_REVIEWER_PARALLELIZATION state
  - SPAWN_CODE_REVIEWERS_FOR_REVIEW state
  - R217 rule documentation

## FIX APPLIED
```diff
- READ THIS RULE FILE: `$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/rule-library/R151-parallel-agent-timestamp.md`
+ READ THIS RULE FILE: `$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/rule-library/R151-parallel-agent-spawning-timing.md`
```

## VERIFICATION
- ✅ File exists and is readable
- ✅ Permissions: -rw-rw-r-- (readable by all)
- ✅ Content verified (parallel spawning timing rules present)
- ✅ No other incorrect references found
- ✅ Change committed and pushed to repository

## IMPACT
This fix unblocks orchestrators in FIX_BUILD_ISSUES state from:
1. Reading mandatory R151 parallel spawning requirements
2. Properly spawning parallel agents with <5s timestamp deviation
3. Meeting grading criteria for parallelization (15% of grade)

## COMMIT REFERENCE
- Commit: 8680e3e
- Branch: main
- Repository: software-factory-template

## RECOMMENDATIONS
1. No further action required - issue fully resolved
2. All orchestrators can now properly read R151 in FIX_BUILD_ISSUES state
3. Consider adding validation script to detect filename mismatches in future
