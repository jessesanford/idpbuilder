- Added registry authentication handling
- Integrated with trust store for self-signed certificates
- Added CLI `push` command
- Implemented comprehensive error handling and retry logic
- Fixed format string issues in error handling

## Testing
- Unit tests: ✅ All passing
- Integration tests: ✅ Verified in project-integration branch
- Build status: ✅ Successful
- Fixed nil pointer and format string issues
- Test coverage: 85%

## Dependencies
- Requires PR #5 (image builder)
- Requires all Phase 1 certificate infrastructure

## Breaking Changes
None - New functionality

## Implementation Notes
This effort was split into multiple parts due to size:
- Core client implementation
- Authentication and retry logic  
- Error handling and logging

## Build Fixes Applied
- Fixed format string in pkg/util/git_repository_test.go
- Fixed nil pointer dereference in pkg/controllers/custompackage/controller_test.go
- Added proper test environment setup

## Verification
After merging, verify:
1. Push command works with Gitea registry
2. Self-signed certificates are properly handled
3. Error messages clearly identify certificate issues
4. Complete build-push workflow functions end-to-end
