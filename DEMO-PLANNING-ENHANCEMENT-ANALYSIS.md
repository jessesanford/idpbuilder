# üé¨ DEMO PLANNING ENHANCEMENT ANALYSIS

**Analysis Date**: 2025-01-10
**Analyst**: Software Factory Manager
**Subject**: Demo Creation Workflow Optimization

## üìä CURRENT STATE ANALYSIS

### 1. Current Demo Creation Location
**Location**: SW Engineer - IMPLEMENTATION state
**Timing**: During code implementation
**Rule**: R291 (Integration Demo Requirement)

### 2. Current Workflow Issues

#### ‚ùå Problem 1: Demos Created Without Prior Planning
- SW Engineers create demos AFTER implementation
- No demo requirements in effort plans
- Demo scope discovered during coding
- Results in reactive demo creation

#### ‚ùå Problem 2: No Demo Specification Before Implementation
- Effort plans lack demo requirements section
- No "what to demonstrate" guidance
- SW Engineers must guess what to demo
- Inconsistent demo quality across efforts

#### ‚ùå Problem 3: Integration Agent Has Limited Demo Role
- Integration Agent only RUNS existing demos
- Cannot create unified integration demos
- Cannot plan cross-effort demonstrations
- Limited to verifying individual effort demos

#### ‚ùå Problem 4: Demo Scope Not Part of Size Estimation
- Demo creation adds ~50-150 lines per effort
- Not included in effort size planning
- Can push efforts over 800-line limit
- Demo scripts + documentation often overlooked

## üöÄ RECOMMENDED ENHANCEMENTS

### 1. üî¥üî¥üî¥ ADD DEMO PLANNING TO EFFORT PLANS üî¥üî¥üî¥

**Enhancement**: Mandatory Demo Requirements Section in Effort Plans

```markdown
## üé¨ DEMO REQUIREMENTS (R291 MANDATORY)

### Demo Objectives
- [ ] Demonstrate [Feature 1] working correctly
- [ ] Show [Feature 2] integration point
- [ ] Verify [Feature 3] error handling
- [ ] Prove performance meets requirements

### Demo Scenarios (EXACTLY these, no more)
1. **Scenario: Create Resource**
   - Input: Valid resource data
   - Action: POST /api/resource
   - Expected: 201 Created, resource ID returned
   - Lines: ~20 for demo script

2. **Scenario: Handle Invalid Input**
   - Input: Malformed JSON
   - Action: POST /api/resource
   - Expected: 400 Bad Request with error message
   - Lines: ~15 for demo script

### Demo Artifacts Required
- [ ] `demo-features.sh` - Executable demo script (~50 lines)
- [ ] `DEMO.md` - Demo documentation (~80 lines)
- [ ] Test data files if needed (~30 lines)
- **TOTAL DEMO OVERHEAD**: ~130 lines (INCLUDE IN SIZE ESTIMATE!)

### Demo Success Criteria
- Script exits with code 0
- All scenarios execute without errors
- Output clearly shows feature working
- Can be run in clean environment
```

### 2. üîÑ INTEGRATION AGENT DEMO ORCHESTRATION

**Enhancement**: Give Integration Agent Demo Composition Responsibilities

```markdown
## Integration Agent Enhanced Demo Role

### Phase 1: Demo Planning (NEW)
- Review individual effort demo plans
- Create integration demo strategy
- Identify cross-effort demo scenarios
- Plan unified demonstration flow

### Phase 2: Demo Composition (NEW)
- Create wave-level demo orchestration script
- Combine individual effort demos logically
- Add integration-specific demonstrations
- Create comprehensive demo documentation

### Phase 3: Demo Execution (EXISTING)
- Run individual effort demos
- Run composed integration demo
- Capture results and evidence
- Report demo status

### Example Integration Demo Script
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Wave Integration Demo Orchestrator

echo "üé¨ WAVE X INTEGRATION DEMO"
echo "=========================="

# Phase 1: Individual Effort Demos
echo "üì¶ Running Effort Demos..."
for effort in effort1 effort2 effort3; do
    echo "  Running $effort demo..."
    ./efforts/$effort/demo-features.sh || exit 1
done

# Phase 2: Integration Scenarios
echo "üîó Running Integration Scenarios..."

# Scenario 1: End-to-end workflow
echo "  Scenario: Complete workflow across efforts"
# Commands that use features from multiple efforts
curl -X POST localhost:8080/effort1/create | \
    jq .id | \
    xargs -I {} curl localhost:8080/effort2/process/{} | \
    jq .result | \
    xargs -I {} curl localhost:8080/effort3/finalize/{}

# Scenario 2: Performance under load
echo "  Scenario: Concurrent operations"
# Demonstrate system handles multiple requests

echo "‚úÖ Integration Demo Complete!"
```

### 3. üìã EFFORT PLAN TEMPLATE UPDATES

**File to Update**: `/home/vscode/software-factory-template/templates/EFFORT-PLANNING-TEMPLATE.md`

**Add After Acceptance Criteria Section**:

```markdown
## üé¨ Demo Requirements (R291 Mandatory)

### Demo Objectives
List 3-5 specific things that MUST be demonstrated:
- [ ] [Specific feature or behavior to demonstrate]
- [ ] [Integration point to verify]
- [ ] [Error handling to show]
- [ ] [Performance characteristic to prove]

### Demo Scenarios
Define EXACT scenarios to implement (prevents scope creep):

#### Scenario 1: [Name]
- **Setup**: [Initial conditions]
- **Action**: [What to do]
- **Verification**: [Expected result]
- **Script Lines**: ~[N] lines

#### Scenario 2: [Name]
- **Setup**: [Initial conditions]
- **Action**: [What to do]
- **Verification**: [Expected result]
- **Script Lines**: ~[N] lines

### Demo Size Impact
```
Demo Script: ~50 lines
Demo Documentation: ~80 lines
Test Data: ~20 lines
TOTAL DEMO OVERHEAD: ~150 lines
```
**NOTE**: This IS included in the 800-line limit!

### Demo Deliverables
- [ ] `demo-features.sh` - Executable script
- [ ] `DEMO.md` - Documentation per template
- [ ] Test data files (if needed)
- [ ] Integration hooks for wave demo
```

### 4. üî¥ NEW RULE: R324 - Demo Planning Requirements

**Create New Rule**: `R324-demo-planning-requirements.md`

```markdown
# üö®üö®üö® RULE R324: Demo Planning Requirements

## Classification
- **Category**: Planning & Documentation
- **Criticality Level**: üö®üö®üö® BLOCKING
- **Enforcement**: MANDATORY for all effort plans
- **Penalty**: -25% for missing demo requirements

## The Rule

**EVERY effort plan MUST include explicit demo requirements specifying WHAT to demonstrate, HOW to demonstrate it, and the SIZE IMPACT of demo artifacts.**

## Requirements

### 1. Demo Objectives (WHAT)
- List 3-5 specific features/behaviors to demonstrate
- Be explicit about success criteria
- Include both positive and negative scenarios

### 2. Demo Scenarios (HOW)
- Define exact scenarios with inputs/outputs
- Specify setup requirements
- Include verification steps
- Estimate script lines for each scenario

### 3. Size Impact (SIZE)
- Include demo artifacts in size calculation
- Typically 100-150 lines for demos
- Must fit within 800-line limit
- Account for script + documentation + test data

## Enforcement
- Code Reviewer: MUST include demo section in plans
- SW Engineer: MUST implement exactly as specified
- Integration Agent: MUST verify demos match plan

## Penalty
- Missing demo requirements: -25%
- Demo not matching plan: -25%
- Demo overhead causing size violation: -50%
```

## üéØ IMPLEMENTATION PRIORITY

### Phase 1: Immediate (High Priority)
1. Update effort planning template with demo section
2. Create R324 rule for demo planning
3. Update Code Reviewer EFFORT_PLAN_CREATION rules

### Phase 2: Short Term (Medium Priority)

2. Build demo evidence collection system
3. Implement demo performance metrics

## üìã SUMMARY RECOMMENDATIONS

### For User's Questions:

1. **What state should SW Engineers create demos?**
   - **KEEP**: IMPLEMENTATION state (current)
   - **ADD**: Demo PLANNING in effort plans (new)

2. **Should Integration Agent create demos instead?**
   - **NO**: SW Engineers create effort demos
   - **YES**: Integration Agent creates integration demos
   - **ENHANCE**: Integration Agent composes unified demos

3. **Do we need demo planning phase?**
   - **YES**: Add to EFFORT_PLAN_CREATION state
   - **CRITICAL**: Include demo requirements in plans
   - **MANDATORY**: Size demo artifacts upfront

4. **Should demo requirements be in effort plans?**
   - **ABSOLUTELY YES**: This is the key improvement
   - **INCLUDE**: Objectives, scenarios, size impact
   - **ENFORCE**: Via new R324 rule

## üöÄ NEXT STEPS

1. **Review this analysis** with stakeholders
2. **Approve rule changes** (especially R324)
3. **Update templates** with demo sections
4. **Modify agent rules** to enforce demo planning
5. **Test with pilot effort** to validate approach

---

**Bottom Line**: The current system creates demos reactively. By adding demo planning to effort plans, we ensure demos are properly scoped, sized, and integrated from the start. This prevents scope creep, improves consistency, and enables better integration demonstrations.
