# Orchestrator State Rules Completion Report

**Date**: 2025-09-06
**Agent**: software-factory-manager
**Task**: Create missing orchestrator state rule files

## Executive Summary

Successfully created 5 missing orchestrator state directories and their corresponding rule files to ensure 100% coverage of all states defined in SOFTWARE-FACTORY-STATE-MACHINE.md.

## Problem Identified

The orchestrator was encountering errors when trying to load state rules for certain states, specifically reporting:
- `AWAIT_PHASE_PLAN` - Invalid state (not in state machine)
- Missing rule files for several valid states

## Analysis Performed

1. **State Machine Analysis**
   - Read SOFTWARE-FACTORY-STATE-MACHINE.md
   - Extracted all 68 valid orchestrator states
   - Identified that `AWAIT_PHASE_PLAN` is NOT a valid state

2. **Directory Audit**
   - Scanned /agent-states/orchestrator/ directory
   - Found 63 existing state directories
   - Identified 5 missing state directories

## Missing States Identified

1. **SPAWN_CODE_REVIEWER_PHASE_MERGE_PLAN**
   - Type: Spawn state
   - Purpose: Spawn Code Reviewer to create phase merge plan

2. **SPAWN_INTEGRATION_AGENT_PHASE**
   - Type: Spawn state
   - Purpose: Spawn Integration Agent for phase-level merges

3. **WAITING_FOR_MERGE_PLAN**
   - Type: Waiting/monitoring state
   - Purpose: Monitor Code Reviewer creating wave merge plan

4. **WAITING_FOR_PHASE_FIX_PLANS**
   - Type: Waiting/monitoring state
   - Purpose: Monitor fix plan creation for phase failures

5. **WAITING_FOR_PHASE_MERGE_PLAN**
   - Type: Waiting/monitoring state
   - Purpose: Monitor phase merge plan creation

## Actions Taken

### For Each Missing State:

1. **Created State Directory**
   ```bash
   mkdir -p /agent-states/orchestrator/[STATE_NAME]
   ```

2. **Created Comprehensive Rules File**
   Each rules.md file includes:
   - State purpose and description
   - Critical rules (R322, R313, R290, etc.)
   - Required actions with code examples
   - Transition rules (valid/invalid)
   - Common violations to avoid
   - Verification commands
   - References to rule library

### Rules Applied to Each State:

#### Spawn States (SPAWN_* states):
- **R322**: Mandatory stop before state transition
- **R313**: Mandatory stop after spawning agents
- **R290**: State rule verification
- **R208**: Spawn directory protocol
- **R287**: TODO persistence
- Additional state-specific rules

#### Waiting States (WAITING_* states):
- **R322**: Mandatory stop before state transition
- **R233**: Immediate action required (no passive waiting)
- **R232**: Monitor state requirements
- **R290**: State rule verification
- **R287**: TODO persistence
- Active monitoring patterns with timeout handling

## Verification Results

```
Total orchestrator states in state machine: 68
Total orchestrator state directories: 68
Coverage: 100%

Newly created states verification:
✓ SPAWN_CODE_REVIEWER_PHASE_MERGE_PLAN/rules.md (146 lines)
✓ SPAWN_INTEGRATION_AGENT_PHASE/rules.md (173 lines)
✓ WAITING_FOR_MERGE_PLAN/rules.md (190 lines)
✓ WAITING_FOR_PHASE_FIX_PLANS/rules.md (252 lines)
✓ WAITING_FOR_PHASE_MERGE_PLAN/rules.md (282 lines)
```

## Key Rules Emphasized

### For Spawn States:
1. **R313 Enforcement**: MUST stop immediately after spawning
2. **R208 Compliance**: Correct directory and branch setup
3. **State Recording**: Update orchestrator-state.json

### For Waiting States:
1. **R233 Active Monitoring**: No passive waiting allowed
2. **R232 Todo Processing**: Check TodoWrite before transitions
3. **Timeout Handling**: 30-45 minute timeouts with ERROR_RECOVERY

## Impact

This fix ensures:
1. **No More Missing State Errors**: Orchestrator can enter any valid state
2. **Consistent Rule Application**: All states have proper rules
3. **R322 Compliance**: Stop before transition rules in place
4. **R313 Compliance**: Spawn states properly configured
5. **R233 Compliance**: Waiting states have active monitoring

## Invalid State Note

**AWAIT_PHASE_PLAN** is NOT a valid state and should never be used. If the orchestrator references this state, it indicates:
- Possible typo in code
- Outdated state reference
- Should likely be WAITING_FOR_ARCHITECTURE_PLAN or similar

## Files Created

1. `/agent-states/orchestrator/SPAWN_CODE_REVIEWER_PHASE_MERGE_PLAN/rules.md`
2. `/agent-states/orchestrator/SPAWN_INTEGRATION_AGENT_PHASE/rules.md`
3. `/agent-states/orchestrator/WAITING_FOR_MERGE_PLAN/rules.md`
4. `/agent-states/orchestrator/WAITING_FOR_PHASE_FIX_PLANS/rules.md`
5. `/agent-states/orchestrator/WAITING_FOR_PHASE_MERGE_PLAN/rules.md`

## Recommendations

1. **State Machine Validation**: Orchestrator should validate states against SOFTWARE-FACTORY-STATE-MACHINE.md
2. **Pre-flight Checks**: Before state transition, verify target state directory exists
3. **Error Messages**: If state not found, suggest closest valid state
4. **Continuous Monitoring**: Regular audits to ensure state coverage

## Conclusion

All orchestrator states defined in the state machine now have corresponding rule files. The system is fully configured to handle any valid state transition without missing rule errors.
