# ERROR_RECOVERY State Rule Reference Fix Report

## Date: 2025-09-01
## Agent: software-factory-manager

## Problem Identified

The `agent-states/orchestrator/ERROR_RECOVERY/rules.md` file contained incorrect references to two rule files that caused broken links:

1. **R019** - Referenced as `R019-error-recovery.md` 
   - Actual filename: `R019-error-recovery-protocol.md`
   
2. **R156** - Referenced as `R156-error-recovery-time.md`
   - Actual filename: `R156-error-recovery-time-targets.md`

## Investigation Performed

1. **Initial Check**: Verified that ERROR_RECOVERY/rules.md existed
2. **Rule File Discovery**: Found that both R019 and R156 files existed but with different names
3. **Comprehensive Verification**: Checked all 9 rules referenced in ERROR_RECOVERY state

## Resolution Applied

### Files Modified
- `/home/vscode/software-factory-template/agent-states/orchestrator/ERROR_RECOVERY/rules.md`

### Changes Made

1. **R019 Reference Fix**:
   - OLD: `$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/rule-library/R019-error-recovery.md`
   - NEW: `$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/rule-library/R019-error-recovery-protocol.md`

2. **R156 Reference Fix**:
   - OLD: `$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/rule-library/R156-error-recovery-time.md`
   - NEW: `$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/rule-library/R156-error-recovery-time-targets.md`

## Verification Results

All rule files referenced in ERROR_RECOVERY/rules.md now exist:

- ✅ R019-error-recovery-protocol.md
- ✅ R021-orchestrator-never-stops.md
- ✅ R156-error-recovery-time-targets.md
- ✅ R010-wrong-location-handling.md
- ✅ R258-mandatory-wave-review-report.md
- ✅ R257-mandatory-phase-assessment-report.md
- ✅ R259-mandatory-phase-integration-after-fixes.md
- ✅ R300-comprehensive-fix-management-protocol.md
- ✅ R290-state-rule-reading-verification-supreme-law.md

## Impact Assessment

### Before Fix
- Agents entering ERROR_RECOVERY state would fail when trying to read R019 and R156
- Rule acknowledgment process would be blocked
- Error recovery operations could not proceed properly

### After Fix
- All rule references are valid and accessible
- Agents can properly read and acknowledge all ERROR_RECOVERY rules
- Error recovery operations can proceed as designed

## System Consistency

This fix ensures:
1. **Rule Library Integrity**: All references point to actual files
2. **State Machine Compliance**: ERROR_RECOVERY state can function properly
3. **Agent Operation**: Orchestrator can successfully enter and execute ERROR_RECOVERY state

## Recommendations

1. **Preventive Measure**: When creating or renaming rule files, search for all references across the system
2. **Validation Script**: Consider adding a script to validate all rule references across all state files
3. **Naming Convention**: Maintain consistent naming patterns for rule files

## Conclusion

The missing rule reference issue has been successfully resolved. The ERROR_RECOVERY state now has all correct rule file references and can function as designed. The system's rule reference integrity has been restored.
