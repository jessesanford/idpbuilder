# Fix Plan: Build Failure - Duplicate PushCmd Declaration

## Issue Summary

The Phase 1 Wave 1 integration build fails with a duplicate declaration error:
```
pkg/cmd/push/root.go:13:5: PushCmd redeclared
pkg/cmd/push/push.go:18:5: other declaration of PushCmd
```

Two different efforts independently created `PushCmd` variables in the same package, causing a compilation error. Both files declare `var PushCmd = &cobra.Command{...}` in the `push` package.

## Root Cause

This is a classic merge conflict that wasn't caught during integration:

1. **Effort P1W1-E4** (CLI Contracts) created `pkg/cmd/push/push.go` with basic push command structure
2. **Another effort** created `pkg/cmd/push/root.go` with enhanced push command including authentication
3. Both files declared the same package-level variable `PushCmd`
4. During integration, since the files had different names, Git didn't detect the semantic conflict
5. The build system detected the duplicate symbol during compilation

## Analysis of Both Declarations

### root.go Declaration (Lines 13-31)
- **More complete implementation** with authentication support
- Uses auth package integration
- Has comprehensive examples in Long description
- Implements `runPush()` function with credential validation
- Has proper error handling and logging
- More production-ready

### push.go Declaration (Lines 18-24)
- **Simpler/basic implementation** focused on TLS configuration
- Only has `insecure` flag for TLS
- Minimal error handling
- Less complete implementation
- Appears to be earlier/prototype version

## Recommended Solution

**Keep `root.go` and remove the duplicate declaration from `push.go`.**

**Rationale**:
- root.go has more complete functionality (authentication, validation, logging)
- root.go follows better CLI patterns with comprehensive help text
- root.go integrates with the auth package (likely from P1W1-E4 authentication effort)
- push.go can retain its TLS-related constants and helper functions if needed

## Fix Instructions

### Step 1: Identify Which Effort Created Each File

Check git history to determine which effort branches introduced each file:
```bash
cd integration-workspace
git log --all --oneline --decorate -- pkg/cmd/push/root.go
git log --all --oneline --decorate -- pkg/cmd/push/push.go
```

This will tell us which effort branches need the fix applied.

### Step 2: Modify push.go

In `pkg/cmd/push/push.go`, remove the duplicate `PushCmd` declaration and associated code:

**REMOVE these lines (18-42):**
```go
var PushCmd = &cobra.Command{
	Use:          "push",
	Short:        "Push OCI artifacts to Gitea registry",
	Long:         `Push OCI artifacts to Gitea registry with support for TLS configuration`,
	RunE:         pushRun,
	SilenceUsage: true,
}

func init() {
	// Add insecure flag for TLS configuration
	PushCmd.Flags().BoolVar(&insecure, "insecure", false, insecureUsage)
}

func pushRun(cmd *cobra.Command, args []string) error {
	// Display warning when insecure mode is used
	if insecure {
		fmt.Printf("⚠️  WARNING: Running in insecure mode - TLS certificate verification disabled\n")
		fmt.Printf("   This should only be used with self-signed certificates in development environments\n\n")
	}

	// TODO: Implement actual push logic in future efforts
	fmt.Printf("Push command executed with insecure flag: %v\n", insecure)

	return nil
}
```

### Step 3: Integrate TLS Flag into root.go (Optional Enhancement)

If the `insecure` flag from push.go is needed, merge it into root.go's init() function:

**In root.go line 40 (after existing flags), ADD:**
```go
	PushCmd.Flags().Bool("insecure", false, "Skip TLS certificate verification (use for self-signed certificates)")
```

This is already present in root.go line 39, so no change needed!

### Step 4: Final State of push.go

After removal, `push.go` should contain only constants (if they're used elsewhere):

```go
package push

const (
	insecureUsage = "Skip TLS certificate verification (use for self-signed certificates)"
)

// If the insecure var is used elsewhere, keep it:
var (
	// Flags
	insecure bool
)
```

**OR** if constants/vars are not used elsewhere, delete the entire file.

### Step 5: Verify No Other References

Check if `push.go` exports anything else that's used:
```bash
cd integration-workspace
grep -r "push\." --include="*.go" | grep -v "push.go" | grep -v "test"
```

If no references found to push.go exports, safe to delete the file entirely.

## Implementation Steps for SW Engineer

1. **Navigate to integration workspace**:
   ```bash
   cd efforts/phase1/wave2/integration-workspace
   ```

2. **Check which effort branches need fixing**:
   ```bash
   # Find which effort created push.go
   git log --all --oneline --follow -- pkg/cmd/push/push.go | head -5
   ```

3. **Option A: Delete entire push.go file** (RECOMMENDED):
   ```bash
   rm pkg/cmd/push/push.go
   git add pkg/cmd/push/push.go
   git commit -m "fix: remove duplicate PushCmd declaration from push.go

   root.go contains the complete implementation with auth support.
   push.go was a simpler version that causes duplicate symbol error.

   Resolves build failure: PushCmd redeclared"
   ```

4. **Option B: Keep push.go with only unique constants** (if needed elsewhere):
   - Edit `push.go` to remove PushCmd, init(), and pushRun()
   - Keep only constants/vars that are referenced elsewhere
   - Commit changes

## Verification Steps

After making the fix:

1. **Verify build succeeds**:
   ```bash
   cd integration-workspace
   go build ./cmd/idpbuilder-push-oci
   ```
   Expected: Build completes without errors

2. **Verify push command exists**:
   ```bash
   go build -o idpbuilder-push-oci ./cmd/idpbuilder-push-oci
   ./idpbuilder-push-oci push --help
   ```
   Expected: Help text displays from root.go implementation

3. **Run package tests**:
   ```bash
   go test ./pkg/cmd/push/...
   ```
   Expected: All tests pass

4. **Verify all flags present**:
   ```bash
   ./idpbuilder-push-oci push --help | grep -E "insecure|username|password|verbose"
   ```
   Expected: All flags visible (insecure, username, password, verbose)

## Affected Efforts

Based on the integration reports, this fix needs to be applied to:

1. **Integration Branch**: `phase1-wave1-integration` (PRIORITY)
   - Fix directly in integration workspace
   - This unblocks the build immediately

2. **Original Effort Branch** (that created push.go):
   - Identify via git log
   - Apply same fix to prevent issue in future merges
   - Likely one of: P1W1-E1, P1W1-E2, P1W1-E3, or P1W1-E4

## Post-Fix Actions

After successful fix:
1. Re-run integration build verification
2. Re-run all tests
3. Update integration report status to BUILD: ✅ PASSED
4. Proceed with demo script creation (next fix plan)

## Notes for Future Prevention

- Consider adding pre-merge build validation
- Enforce naming conventions for cobra commands
- Add linting rules to detect duplicate symbol declarations
- Update integration agent to run `go build` before completing merge
