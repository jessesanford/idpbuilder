- ✅ Edge cases handled
  - Empty registry names
  - Invalid certificates
  - Missing directories
  - Concurrent access (mutex protection)
- ✅ Error handling appropriate
  - Clear error messages
  - Proper error propagation
  - No panic conditions

### Code Quality
- ✅ Clean, readable code
  - Well-structured packages (certs, build)
  - Clear separation of concerns
  - Consistent coding style
- ✅ Proper variable naming
  - Descriptive names (TrustStoreManager, TransportConfig)
  - Go conventions followed
- ✅ Appropriate comments
  - Interface methods documented
  - Complex logic explained
  - Package documentation present
- ✅ No code smells detected
  - No duplicate code
  - No overly complex functions
  - Proper abstraction levels

### Test Coverage
- **Unit Tests**: 19 test files found
- **Test Quality**: EXCELLENT
  - ✅ Tests cover happy paths
  - ✅ Tests cover error cases
  - ✅ Tests cover edge cases
  - ✅ Tests are independent
  - ✅ Tests have clear names
  - ✅ All tests passing
- **Coverage Areas**:
  - TrustStoreManager operations
  - Certificate validation
  - Transport configuration
  - Error handling scenarios

### Pattern Compliance
- ✅ Go best practices followed
  - Interface-based design
  - Proper error handling
  - Context usage where appropriate
- ✅ API conventions correct
  - Standard Go naming conventions
  - Proper package organization
- ✅ Consistent with project patterns
  - Uses existing k8s client patterns
  - Follows controller-runtime conventions where applicable

### Security Review
- ✅ No security vulnerabilities detected
  - Proper certificate validation
  - No hardcoded credentials
  - Secure TLS configuration defaults
- ✅ Input validation present
  - Certificate format validation
  - Registry name validation
- ✅ Proper error handling prevents information leakage

## Split Implementation Analysis

### Split 001: Core Trust Store Management (511 lines)
- **Status**: ✅ Complete
- **Components**:
  - TrustStoreManager interface and implementation
  - Certificate loading and storage
  - Insecure registry management
  - Basic unit tests
- **Size Compliance**: ✅ Under 800 lines

### Split 002: Transport Configuration and Utilities (468 lines)
- **Status**: ✅ Complete
- **Components**:
  - Transport configuration for go-containerregistry
  - Certificate utility functions
  - PEM encoding/decoding utilities
  - Additional tests
- **Size Compliance**: ✅ Under 800 lines

## Issues Found
No critical issues found. The implementation has been properly split and both splits are within size limits.

## Recommendations
1. **Documentation**: Consider adding more inline documentation for complex certificate operations
2. **Testing**: Current test coverage is good, consider adding integration tests with actual registry operations
3. **Monitoring**: Consider adding metrics/logging for certificate rotation events
4. **Performance**: Certificate pool creation could be cached for frequently accessed registries

## Next Steps
[ACCEPTED WITH SPLIT]: Implementation has been properly split into two parts:
- Split 001: Core trust store (511 lines) - Ready for integration
- Split 002: Transport and utilities (468 lines) - Ready for integration

Both splits are within size limits and maintain logical cohesion. The effort successfully implements the required TLS trust integration for registry operations.

## Verification Checklist
- ✅ Size limit compliance (after split)
- ✅ Functionality complete
- ✅ Tests passing
- ✅ Code quality standards met
- ✅ Security requirements satisfied
- ✅ Split plan executed successfully

## Final Verdict
**PASSED** - The effort has been successfully implemented and split according to size requirements. Both splits are ready for integration into the main branch.
