## Fixes Applied

### Priority 1: Integration States (COMPLETED)
Fixed 10 critical errors by adding missing rules to integration states:

| State | Rules Added |
|-------|------------|
| PROJECT_INTEGRATION | R321, R280, R307 |
| FINAL_INTEGRATION | R321, R280, R307 |
| INTEGRATION | R280, R307 |
| PHASE_INTEGRATION | R280, R307 |

### Priority 2: Spawn/Setup States (COMPLETED)
Fixed 5 critical errors by adding infrastructure rules:

| State | Rules Added |
|-------|------------|
| SPAWN_AGENTS | R216, R235 |
| SETUP_EFFORT_INFRASTRUCTURE | R216, R235 |
| CREATE_NEXT_SPLIT_INFRASTRUCTURE | R221, R216, R235 |

### Priority 3: R322 Addition (COMPLETED)
Fixed 6 critical errors by adding mandatory stop rule:

- MONITORING_PROJECT_INTEGRATION
- SPAWN_CODE_REVIEWER_PROJECT_MERGE_PLAN
- SPAWN_CODE_REVIEWER_PROJECT_VALIDATION
- SPAWN_INTEGRATION_AGENT_PROJECT
- WAITING_FOR_PROJECT_MERGE_PLAN
- WAITING_FOR_PROJECT_VALIDATION

### Priority 4: Missing States (COMPLETED)
Fixed 13 warnings by creating missing state directories with appropriate rules:

**Spawn States Created:**
- SPAWN_CODE_REVIEWERS_FOR_SPLITS (with R208, R216, R235, R151)
- SPAWN_SW_ENGINEERS_FOR_FIXES (with R208, R216, R235, R151, R295)
- SPAWN_ARCHITECT_FOR_WAVE_REVIEW (with R208, R216, R235, R258)
- SPAWN_ARCHITECT_FOR_PHASE_ASSESSMENT (with R208, R216, R235, R257)
- SPAWN_ARCHITECT_FOR_PROJECT_ASSESSMENT (with R208, R216, R235)

**Monitor States Created:**
- MONITOR_EFFORT_PLANNING (with R319)
- MONITOR_SIZE_VALIDATION (with R319)
- MONITOR_CODE_REVIEW (with R319)
- MONITOR_ARCHITECT_REVIEW (with R319)
- MONITOR_FIX_IMPLEMENTATION (with R319)
- MONITOR_TESTING (with R319)

2. **Update Documentation** - Document the new state-based rule system
3. **Test Critical Paths** - Verify all state transitions work correctly
4. **Monitor First Run** - Watch for any edge cases

## Implementation Time

- **Lines Added**: 1,232

## Git Commit

Message: feat: complete orchestrator state rules migration preparation
Branch: orchestrator-rules-to-state-rules
```

## Conclusion

The orchestrator state rules are now fully self-contained. Each state includes all rules it needs, eliminating the need for the massive bootstrap in orchestrator.md. This represents a major simplification of the system architecture while maintaining full rule enforcement.
