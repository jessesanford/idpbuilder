# ERROR RECOVERY PLAN - Phase 1 Wave 2 Integration Failure

## Error Metadata
- **Date**: 2025-09-11
- **Time Started**: 23:04:21 UTC
- **Error ID**: ERR-BUILD-GATE-2025-09-11-001
- **Severity**: CRITICAL (R291 Gate Failures)
- **Recovery Target**: 30 minutes (per R156)
- **Orchestrator State**: ERROR_RECOVERY

## Error Classification (R019)
- **Type**: BUILD_GATE_FAILURE + INTEGRATION_FAILURE
- **Category**: R291 Gate Violations
- **Impact**: Complete build failure, no tests, no demos
- **Root Cause**: Split-001 deleted critical project infrastructure

## Root Cause Analysis

### Primary Issue
**cert-validation-split-001** deleted critical project files:
- Core files: Makefile, main.go, LICENSE, README.md
- Configuration: .gitignore, .goreleaser.yaml, .pre-commit-config.yaml
- Package directories: pkg/build/, pkg/cmd/, pkg/controllers/, pkg/k8s/, pkg/kind/
- Impact: Project cannot compile, test, or run

### Secondary Issues
- No demo scripts in any effort branch (R291 violation)
- Build dependencies cannot be resolved
- Tests cannot run without successful build

## Recovery Strategy (R300 Compliant)

### Core Principles
- ✅ ALL fixes will be applied to EFFORT branches (never integration)
- ✅ Orchestrator delegates all fixes to SW Engineers
- ✅ Each fix tracked and verified before re-integration
- ✅ Fresh integration branch after fixes complete

### Fix Assignments

#### Assignment 1: Critical Infrastructure Restoration
- **Agent**: SW Engineer #1
- **Target Branch**: cert-validation-split-001
- **Working Directory**: /home/vscode/workspaces/idpbuilder-oci-build-push/efforts/phase1/wave2/cert-validation-split-001
- **Tasks**:
  1. Restore all deleted project infrastructure files
  2. Keep only the cert validation additions
  3. Create demo-cert-validation.sh demonstrating cert features
  4. Ensure build passes locally
  5. Push fixes to remote effort branch

#### Assignment 2: Demo Script Creation
- **Agent**: SW Engineer #2
- **Target Branches**: Multiple effort branches
- **Tasks**:
  1. Add demo script to cert-validation-split-002
  2. Add demo script to cert-validation-split-003
  3. Add demo script to fallback-strategies
  4. Each demo must demonstrate the specific features of that effort
  5. Push all changes to respective remote effort branches

## Recovery Timeline

| Time | Activity | Status |
|------|----------|--------|
| 00:00-00:05 | Error analysis and planning | ✅ Complete |
| 00:05-00:10 | Spawn SW Engineers with fix instructions | In Progress |
| 00:10-00:20 | Engineers apply fixes in effort branches | Pending |
| 00:20-00:25 | Verify fixes per R300 protocol | Pending |
| 00:25-00:30 | Create fresh integration and test | Pending |

## Verification Checklist (R300)

Before re-integration, verify:
- [ ] cert-validation-split-001 has restored infrastructure files
- [ ] cert-validation-split-001 builds successfully
- [ ] All effort branches have demo scripts
- [ ] All fixes committed to effort branches (not integration)
- [ ] All fixes pushed to remote effort branches
- [ ] No fixes in integration branch

## Next State Transition

After successful recovery:
- Current State: ERROR_RECOVERY
- Next State: INTEGRATION (create fresh integration branch)
- Transition Condition: All fixes verified in effort branches

## Recovery Metrics

- Recovery Start: 2025-09-11T23:04:21Z
- Target Completion: 2025-09-11T23:34:21Z (30 min)
- Escalation Trigger: 2025-09-11T23:19:21Z (15 min)

## Notes

This recovery follows:
- R300: All fixes in effort branches only
- R019: Systematic error recovery protocol
- R156: 30-minute recovery target for CRITICAL errors
- R291: Build/Test/Demo gates must pass
- R006: Orchestrator never writes code
