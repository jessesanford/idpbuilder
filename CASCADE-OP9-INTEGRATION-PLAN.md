# CASCADE Op #9: Final Project Integration Plan
Date: 2025-09-19 21:02:00 UTC
Target Branch: idpbuilder-oci-build-push/project-integration

## CASCADE CONTEXT
This is the FINAL CASCADE operation (#9) combining all phases into the complete project.

## Branches to Integrate (ordered by dependency)
1. origin/idpbuilder-oci-build-push/phase1/integration (Phase 1 complete)
2. origin/idpbuilder-oci-build-push/phase2-integration-cascade-20250919-210005 (Phase 2 CASCADE complete)

## Merge Strategy
- Base from main branch
- Merge Phase 1 integration first (foundational changes)
- Merge Phase 2 integration second (builds on Phase 1)
- Document all conflict resolutions
- Preserve complete commit history (NO cherry-picking)

## Expected Outcome
- Fully integrated project with all Phase 1 and Phase 2 features
- Clean build and passing tests
- Complete documentation of integration process
- Branch pushed to remote as final deliverable

## Success Criteria
- All features from both phases preserved
- No code lost during merge
- Build succeeds
- Tests pass (or failures documented as upstream issues)
- Total line count within acceptable limits
- CASCADE completion confirmed
