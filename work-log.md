  - Task: Resolve critical build failures per ERROR-RECOVERY-FIX-PLAN.md
  - Finding: cli-commands effort branch already had correct implementations
  - Verification: All builds pass, interfaces match expected signatures
  - Status: No code changes required - effort was already correct

  - Completion: Created FIX_COMPLETE.flag marker for orchestrator
