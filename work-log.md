# Work Log - Effort 1.1.2: Command Skeleton

## Planning Session - 2025-09-22

### 23:05 UTC - Code Reviewer Agent Started
- Agent: code-reviewer
- State: EFFORT_PLAN_CREATION
- Task: Create implementation plan for effort 1.1.2

### 23:06 UTC - Pre-flight Checks Completed
- Verified working directory: efforts/phase1/wave1/effort-1.1.2-command-skeleton
- Confirmed Git branch: idpbuilderpush/phase1/wave1/command-skeleton
- Repository: https://github.com/jessesanford/idpbuilder.git

### 23:07 UTC - Dependency Analysis (R374)
- Analyzed effort 1.1.1 test file: cmd/push/root_test.go
- Identified 7 test functions that must pass
- Extracted required command structure and flags
- Documented test expectations for TDD GREEN phase

### 23:07 UTC - Existing Code Research
- Examined pkg/cmd/root.go for cobra patterns
- Reviewed create/delete/get command implementations
- Identified reusable patterns and helpers
- Ensured no duplicate implementations (R373)

### 23:08 UTC - Implementation Plan Created
- Created .software-factory/ directory (R343)
- Generated timestamped plan: IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN-20250922-230813.md
- Defined explicit scope: ~180 lines (under 200 budget)
- Listed exact functions and structures to implement
- Included DO NOT IMPLEMENT section to prevent scope creep

### Key Planning Decisions:
1. **Minimal Implementation**: Only code to pass tests, no actual push logic
2. **File Structure**:
   - cmd/push/root.go (~120 lines)
   - cmd/push/config.go (~30 lines)
   - Optional cmd/push/push.go (~30 lines)
3. **TDD Compliance**: Tests must be imported first and fail initially
4. **Production Ready**: No stubs/TODOs, but RunE returning nil is valid for GREEN phase

### Next Steps for SW Engineer:
1. Copy root_test.go from effort 1.1.1
2. Verify tests fail (RED phase confirmation)
3. Implement minimal code to pass tests
4. Measure with line-counter tool
5. Commit and push when all tests pass

### Plan Location:
- Path: .software-factory/IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN-20250922-230813.md
- Ready for orchestrator tracking per R340
