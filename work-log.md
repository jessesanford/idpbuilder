## Features Implemented:
- ValidationMode enum (Strict, Lenient, Insecure)
- ChainValidationOptions configuration struct
- TrustStoreProvider interface abstraction
- ChainValidator with configurable validation modes
- Complete chain validation including:
  - Chain length validation
  - Certificate ordering verification
  - Trust chain validation
  - Signature verification
  - Hostname verification
