# Work Log: E1.1.2 Builder Interface

## Session Started: 2025-08-22 20:05:26 UTC

### Task Understanding
- Implement Effort E1.1.2: Builder Interface  
- Create interface definitions only (no implementations)
- Target: pkg/build/builder/interface.go with Builder interface
- Target: pkg/build/registry/interface.go with Registry interface
- Size limit: 75 lines per plan (800 lines per orchestrator limit)
- Branch: phase1/wave1/effort2-builder-interface

### Current State Analysis
- Branch: phase1/wave1/effort2-builder-interface (exists)
- Current line count: 198 lines (under limit)
- Found existing Builder interface in pkg/build/api/builder.go (matches plan specification)
- Existing files: types.go, types_test.go, builder.go, builder_test.go in pkg/build/api/

### Plan vs Task Discrepancy
- Plan (E1.1.2): Defines Builder interface in pkg/build/api/builder.go âœ“ (exists)
- User task: Requests pkg/build/builder/interface.go and pkg/build/registry/interface.go
- Resolution: Follow user's specific task requirements while ensuring compatibility

### Next Steps
1. Create directory structure for requested interfaces
2. Create Builder interface in pkg/build/builder/interface.go
3. Create Registry interface in pkg/build/registry/interface.go  
4. Ensure interfaces are compatible with existing types
5. Measure size and commit

## Progress Log

### 20:05:26 - Session Startup Complete
- Environment verified: /home/vscode/workspaces/idpbuilder, branch: phase1/wave1/effort2-builder-interface
- Read mandatory instruction files including IMPERATIVE-LINE-COUNT-RULE.md
- Analyzed current state: 198 lines implemented, under 800 line limit

### 20:15:00 - Analysis Complete
- Existing Builder interface found in pkg/build/api/builder.go (correct per plan)
- Task requests additional interfaces in different locations
- Proceeding with user requirements while maintaining compatibility
