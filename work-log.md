## Previous image-builder Work Log (for reference)

### Image Builder Development History
Start: 2025-09-14T16:46:15Z
Agent: SW Engineer (Rebase Task)
Branch: idpbuilder-oci-build-push/phase2/wave1/image-builder
Rebase Target: origin/idpbuilder-oci-build-push/phase1/integration

### Operation 1: Rebase Initialization

Task: Rebase image-builder branch onto latest phase1/integration
Target Commit: 2c39501 (Integrate Wave 2 into Phase 1)
Status: Completed

### Context
- Image builder is a Phase 2 Wave 1 effort
- Previous base was old phase1/integration commit 4f0e259
- New base includes complete Phase 1 (Wave 1 + Wave 2) work
- This provides proper foundation for Phase 2 development

### Rebase Progress Final
Time: 2025-09-14T16:51:00Z
Status: Complete - Successfully rebased onto phase1/integration
Note: Successfully preserved image-builder implementation with 8 files and 1056 lines
Result: Phase 2 image-builder functionality now based on complete Phase 1 foundation
