# Auth Flow Implementation Effort - Work Log

## 2025-09-24 16:52:04 UTC - Implementation Complete

### Files Created:
- `pkg/oci/flow.go` - Main authentication flow implementation (151 lines)
- `pkg/oci/types.go` - Copied shared types from integration workspace (65 lines, not counted as new)
- `demo-auth-flow.sh` - Demo script with 3 scenarios (57 lines)
- `DEMO.md` - Demo documentation (43 lines)
- `.demo-ready` - Demo ready flag (1 line)

### Implementation Summary:
- **Total NEW implementation**: 151 lines (flow.go only)
- **Total with demo artifacts**: 251 lines
- **Size compliance**: ✅ Well under 300-line estimate and 800-line limit

### Features Implemented:
- ✅ AuthFlow struct with proper configuration
- ✅ AuthFlowConfig for setup parameters
- ✅ FlowCredentials wrapper with source tracking
- ✅ NewAuthFlow constructor (~40 lines as planned)
- ✅ GetCredentials with flag/secret precedence (~50 lines as planned)
- ✅ getFromFlags helper for flag extraction (~30 lines as planned)
- ✅ getFromSecrets helper for K8s secret retrieval (~40 lines as planned)
- ✅ validateCredentials helper for validation (~20 lines as planned)

### Demo Implementation:
- ✅ Flag override scenario - shows flags take precedence
- ✅ Secret fallback scenario - shows K8s secret usage
- ✅ No credentials scenario - shows proper error handling
- ✅ All scenarios tested and working correctly

### Validation:
- ✅ Code compiles without errors
- ✅ Follows implementation plan exactly
- ✅ Demo scripts work for all scenarios
- ✅ Size requirements met (151/800 lines)

### Status: READY FOR TESTING AND REVIEW
