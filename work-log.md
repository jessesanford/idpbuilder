## Merge Operations Log
## MERGE 1: Executing cli-commands merge
Command: git merge FETCH_HEAD --no-ff
Timestamp: 2025-09-16 00:56:10 UTC
Result: Merge with conflicts in work-log.md
Resolution: Preserved both integration log and effort history

## Effort History from cli-commands branch
[2025-09-15 23:42] FIX_ISSUES State - Interface Resolution Analysis
  - Task: Resolve critical build failures per ERROR-RECOVERY-FIX-PLAN.md
  - Finding: cli-commands effort branch already had correct implementations
  - Verification: All builds pass, interfaces match expected signatures
  - Status: No code changes required - effort was already correct
  - Compliance: R300 - worked in effort branch, NOT integration branch
  - Completion: Created FIX_COMPLETE.flag marker for orchestrator

## Post-Merge 1 Verification (cli-commands)
Timestamp: 2025-09-16 00:57:00 UTC
Build Status: SUCCESS
Test Status: PASS (pkg/cmd tests passing)
Demo Status: PASS (demo-features.sh executable and functional)
Files Added: 20+ files including pkg/cmd/build.go, pkg/cmd/push.go
Commit Count: git log shows proper merge history
MERGED: cli-commands at 2025-09-16 00:56:30 UTC

## MERGE 2: Executing credential-management merge
Command: git merge FETCH_HEAD --no-ff
Timestamp: 2025-09-16 00:58:24 UTC
Result: Merge with conflicts in work-log.md
Resolution: Preserving both integration log and credential-management history

## Effort History from credential-management branch
# Work Log: E2.2.2-A credential-management
# Work Log for image-operations (E2.2.2-B)

## Infrastructure Details
- **Branch**: idpbuilder-oci-build-push/phase2/wave2/image-operations
- **Base Branch**: idpbuilder-oci-build-push/phase2/wave2/credential-management
- **Clone Type**: FULL (R271 compliance)
- **Created**: 2025-09-15 21:07:00 UTC

## R308 Incremental Branching Compliance
- **Phase**: 2
- **Wave**: 2
- **Dependency**: E2.2.2-A (credential-management)
- **Incremental**: This is an intra-wave dependency - E2.2.2-B depends on E2.2.2-A
- **Base Selection**: Using credential-management branch as base (contains E2.2.2-A work)

## Purpose
Implements real image operations functionality, removing all placeholders and feature flags.
Second part of E2.2.2 split to stay within size limits.

## Final Status: IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE ✅

## Deliverables Completed
- ✅ All features from IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN.md implemented

## 2025-09-15T19:20:00Z - DISCONNECTION RECOVERY
- **Event**: Agent disconnected during implementation
- **Recovery Mode**: Systematic damage assessment and repair
- **Issues Found & Fixed**:
  1. ❌ Missing go.sum entry for zalando/go-keyring → ✅ Fixed with go get
  2. ❌ Test compilation error (map field assignment) → ✅ Fixed config_test.go
  3. ❌ Test logic expecting hardcoded credentials → ✅ Updated to expect empty defaults
  4. ❌ Wrong environment variable names in test → ✅ Fixed to use GITEA_USERNAME/GITEA_PASSWORD

## 2025-09-15T19:25:00Z - RECOVERY VERIFICATION COMPLETE
- **Build Status**: ✅ Clean (go build ./... passes)
- **Test Status**: ✅ All 18 tests passing (go test ./pkg/gitea/... -v)
- **Size Verification**: ~301 implementation lines (well under 500 limit)
- **Functionality**: ✅ All credential providers working correctly
- **Environment Variables**: ✅ Dynamic reading confirmed (GITEA_USERNAME/GITEA_PASSWORD)
- **CLI Integration**: ✅ --username and --token flags working in push command

## Final Implementation Status
- ✅ **DISCONNECTION DAMAGE REPAIRED**
- ✅ **ALL FEATURES COMPLETE AND TESTED**
- ✅ **IMPLEMENTATION READY FOR REVIEW**

## Next Steps
1. Code review and validation
2. Integration testing with actual Gitea registry
3. Documentation update if needed
