# Phase 1 Wave 2 - Certificate Validation Split 001 Work Log

## Rebase Context
- **Date**: 2025-09-11 14:08:00 UTC
- **Operation**: Rebasing cert-validation-split-001 onto phase1/wave1/integration
- **Base**: Wave 1 integration branch (includes all Wave 1 efforts)
- **Target**: Update Wave 2 to build on integrated Wave 1 foundation

## Step 3: Merge E1.1.1 - Kind Certificate Extraction

Files added: 14 files changed, 3323 insertions(+)
MERGED: kind-cert/phase1/wave1/effort-kind-cert-extraction at 2025-09-06 22:27:00 UTC

## Step 4: Validate E1.1.1 Integration
Date: 2025-09-06 22:27:30 UTC
Command: go build ./...
Result: SUCCESS - Build passed
Command: go test ./pkg/certs/... -v
Result: SUCCESS - All tests passing
Command: grep -r "KindCertValidator" pkg/
Result: SUCCESS - Renamed interface found
Command: grep -r "isKindFeatureEnabled" pkg/
Result: SUCCESS - Renamed function found

## E1.1.2 Implementation History (from effort branch)
[2025-09-06 17:46] Implemented E1.1.2: Registry TLS Trust Integration
  - Files implemented: trust.go (472 lines), transport.go (337 lines), pool.go (367 lines), config.go (331 lines), logging.go (367 lines)
  - Total: 1,874 lines (CRITICAL: Over 800 line limit - needs reduction)
[2025-09-06 17:53] CODE SIZE REDUCTION COMPLETED
  - REDUCED from 1,874 lines to 572 lines (69% reduction)
  - Final implementation: trust.go (266 lines) + utilities.go (306 lines)
  - Tests: All passing with 58.6% coverage

## Step 5: Merge E1.1.2 - Registry TLS Trust Integration
Date: 2025-09-06 22:28:00 UTC
Command: git merge registry-tls/phase1/wave1/effort-registry-tls-trust --no-ff -m "feat: integrate E1.1.2..."
Result: CONFLICT in work-log.md - Resolved by keeping both histories
Files added: trust.go, utilities.go, trust_test.go, utilities_test.go
MERGED: registry-tls/phase1/wave1/effort-registry-tls-trust at 2025-09-06 22:28:00 UTC

## Step 6: Final Integration Validation
Date: 2025-09-06 22:29:00 UTC
Command: go build ./...
Result: SUCCESS - Full build passed
Command: go test ./...
Result: PARTIAL - pkg/certs tests pass, pkg/kind has upstream bug
Command: grep for duplicate declarations
Result: SUCCESS - No duplicates found
- KindCertValidator and RegistryCertValidator both present
- isKindFeatureEnabled and isRegistryFeatureEnabled both present
- No generic versions remain

## Upstream Bug Documentation (R266)
Date: 2025-09-06 22:29:30 UTC
Bug Found: pkg/kind/cluster_test.go:232 - undefined: types.ContainerListOptions
Status: DOCUMENTED - NOT FIXED (per R266)
Recommendation: Update Docker client library version

## Step 7: Documentation and Push
Date: 2025-09-06 22:30:00 UTC
Command: Create INTEGRATION-REPORT.md
Result: SUCCESS - Comprehensive report created
Command: git push origin idpbuilder-oci-build-push/phase1/wave1/integration
Result: SUCCESS - Branch pushed to remote

## Integration Complete
End: 2025-09-06 22:30:00 UTC
Total Duration: 4 minutes
Final Status: ✅ SUCCESSFUL - Wave 1 fully integrated
