  1. CLI flags (highest priority)
  2. Environment variables
  3. Configuration file
  4. System keyring (lowest priority)

## Deliverables Completed
- ✅ All features from IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN.md implemented
- ✅ All credential-related TODOs removed from client.go
- ✅ Comprehensive test suite created
- ✅ Size under 500 lines (implementation only)
- ✅ CLI flags for username/token added to push command
- ✅ Backward compatible credential handling
- ✅ Security considerations implemented
- ✅ Graceful degradation when credentials unavailable

## 2025-09-15T19:20:00Z - DISCONNECTION RECOVERY
- **Event**: Agent disconnected during implementation
- **Recovery Mode**: Systematic damage assessment and repair
- **Issues Found & Fixed**:
  1. ❌ Missing go.sum entry for zalando/go-keyring → ✅ Fixed with go get
  2. ❌ Test compilation error (map field assignment) → ✅ Fixed config_test.go
  3. ❌ Test logic expecting hardcoded credentials → ✅ Updated to expect empty defaults
  4. ❌ Wrong environment variable names in test → ✅ Fixed to use GITEA_USERNAME/GITEA_PASSWORD

## 2025-09-15T19:25:00Z - RECOVERY VERIFICATION COMPLETE
- **Build Status**: ✅ Clean (go build ./... passes)
- **Test Status**: ✅ All 18 tests passing (go test ./pkg/gitea/... -v)
- **Size Verification**: ~301 implementation lines (well under 500 limit)
- **Functionality**: ✅ All credential providers working correctly
- **Environment Variables**: ✅ Dynamic reading confirmed (GITEA_USERNAME/GITEA_PASSWORD)
- **CLI Integration**: ✅ --username and --token flags working in push command

## Final Implementation Status
- ✅ **DISCONNECTION DAMAGE REPAIRED**
- ✅ **ALL FEATURES COMPLETE AND TESTED**
- ✅ **IMPLEMENTATION READY FOR REVIEW**

## Next Steps
1. Code review and validation
2. Integration testing with actual Gitea registry
3. Documentation update if needed
