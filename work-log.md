# Work Log - Effort 1.1.1: Write Command Tests

## Planning Phase - 2025-09-22

### Agent: Code Reviewer
**Timestamp**: 2025-09-22 22:52:22 UTC
**State**: EFFORT_PLAN_CREATION

### Activities Completed:
1. **Agent Initialization** (22:52:22)
   - Acknowledged role as code-reviewer
   - Verified working directory: `/home/vscode/workspaces/idpbuilder-push/efforts/phase1/wave1/effort-1.1.1-write-command-tests`
   - Confirmed git branch: `idpbuilderpush/phase1/wave1/command-tests`

2. **Context Analysis** (22:52:30)
   - Read phase-1-waves.json for effort specifications
   - Identified TDD RED phase requirements
   - Noted existing project dependencies (cobra v1.8.0, testify v1.9.0)

3. **Plan Creation** (22:52:45)
   - Created comprehensive EFFORT-PLAN.md
   - Documented 7 test functions to implement
   - Specified line count estimates per test
   - Included R381 library version compliance

### Key Decisions:
- **Test Structure**: 7 distinct test functions covering all command aspects
- **Size Budget**: 150 lines total (well under 800 limit)
- **Dependencies**: Use existing locked versions (no updates)
- **TDD Focus**: All tests must fail initially (RED phase)

### Files Modified:
- `EFFORT-PLAN.md`: Created comprehensive implementation plan
- `work-log.md`: Documented planning activities

### Next Steps for Implementation:
1. SW Engineer to create `cmd/push/root_test.go`
2. Write all 7 test functions as specified
3. Ensure tests fail (RED phase verification)
4. Measure actual line count with line-counter.sh
5. Commit and push test file

### Notes:
- Project already has necessary dependencies in go.mod
- No need to initialize new Go module
- Tests should reference undefined symbols (expected failures)
- PushConfig struct should be defined in tests for type safety

---

## Implementation Phase (To be completed by SW Engineer)

### Expected Timeline:
- Test creation: 1-2 hours
- Verification of RED phase: 15 minutes
- Total effort time: ~2 hours

### Success Metrics:
- All tests written and failing
- Total lines d 150
- Clear test names and assertions
- No production code included
