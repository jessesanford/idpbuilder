# Work Log - Auth Interface Tests

## Session 1: Implementation Planning
**Date**: 2025-09-23
**Time**: 16:01 UTC
**Status**: COMPLETED

### Tasks Completed
1.  Created comprehensive implementation plan for Auth Interface Tests
2.  Defined TDD RED phase test structure
3.  Specified 4 test suites covering:
   - Credential retrieval from multiple sources
   - Authentication configuration generation
   - Credential validation
   - Error handling scenarios
4.  Outlined expected interfaces to emerge from tests
5.  Set size target at 200 LOC (well under 800 limit)

### Key Decisions
- Focus on test-first development (TDD RED phase)
- Tests define behavior before implementation exists
- Comprehensive coverage of auth scenarios
- Clear separation between test code and fixtures
- Table-driven test approach where appropriate

### Next Steps
1. SW Engineer to implement the test files
2. All tests must initially FAIL (proving they test real behavior)
3. Tests will drive implementation in Phase 2, Wave 2

### Notes
- This effort establishes the authentication contract through tests
- No production code should be written in this effort
- Tests serve as executable specifications
