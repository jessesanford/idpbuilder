# Work Log - Auth Module Implementation (Effort 2.1.2)

## Session Start: 2025-09-23T16:01:48.391Z

### Planning Phase
- **Time**: 16:01 UTC
- **Agent**: Code Reviewer
- **Task**: Create implementation plan for Auth Module
- **State**: EFFORT_PLAN_CREATION

### Activities Completed
1.  Verified workspace location and git branch
2.  Analyzed Phase 2, Wave 1 context
3.  Identified TDD GREEN phase requirements
4.  Located related efforts:
   - auth-interface-tests (Effort 2.1.1 - Tests)
   - auth-implementation (Effort 2.1.2 - Current)
   - auth-mocks (Effort 2.1.3 - Mocks)
5.  Created comprehensive IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN.md

### Key Decisions
- Focus on MINIMAL implementation (GREEN phase of TDD)
- Target 300 LOC as specified
- Structure: pkg/oci/{auth.go, types.go, errors.go}
- Implement Authenticator interface
- Support multiple credential sources

### Implementation Strategy
- **Phase**: GREEN (minimal code to pass tests)
- **Approach**: Just enough functionality
- **Priority**: Make tests pass, not perfect code
- **Size Target**: 300 LOC total

### Files Created
1. `IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN.md` - Detailed implementation guide
2. `work-log.md` - This work log

### Next Steps for SW Engineer
1. Create pkg/oci/ directory structure
2. Implement types.go with interfaces
3. Build minimal auth.go implementation
4. Add basic error handling
5. Test against Effort 2.1.1 tests
6. Measure implementation size regularly

### Notes
- This is GREEN phase - no optimization needed
- Hardcoded values acceptable if tests pass
- Focus on core functionality only
- Refactoring comes in later efforts

### Session End: 16:05 UTC
