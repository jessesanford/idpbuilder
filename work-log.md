# Work Log for registry-tls-trust-integration

## Infrastructure Details
- **Branch**: idpbuidler-oci-go-cr/phase1/wave1/registry-tls-trust-integration
- **Base Branch**: main
- **Clone Type**: FULL (R271 compliance)
- **Created**: $(date)

## Base Branch Selection Rationale
No dependencies - using repository default base branch (main)
Can parallelize with kind-certificate-extraction effort

## Effort Description
Load custom CA into x509.CertPool and configure ggcr remote transport with TLS
