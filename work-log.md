# Work Log for E1.2.2 Split 002
## Status: SIZE LIMIT EXCEEDED - STOPPED IMPLEMENTATION

### Progress Summary
**Started**: 2025-09-01 10:31:12 UTC  
**Files Implemented**: 2 of 4 planned files  
**Current Size**: 1061 lines  
**Size Limit**: 800 lines  
**Status**: ❌ EXCEEDED LIMIT BY 261 LINES

### Files Completed
1. **logger.go** (370 lines) - Security decision logging system
   - SecurityLevel enumeration (INFO/WARNING/CRITICAL/BLOCKED)
   - SecurityLogEntry structure for audit trails
   - SecurityLogger interface with comprehensive logging methods
   - FileSecurityLogger with rotation and retention policies
   - Null logger implementation for testing
   - Concurrent access protection with mutex
   - JSON-based structured logging

2. **recommendations.go** (691 lines) - User-friendly recommendation engine  
   - CertErrorType enumeration for error categorization
   - ErrorDetails and CertificateInfo structures
   - Recommendation and RecommendationAction structures
   - RecommendationEngine interface
   - DefaultRecommendationEngine with registry-specific configs
   - SecurityAssessment for risk evaluation
   - Support for major OCI registries (Docker Hub, GitHub CR, Google CR, Amazon ECR, Azure CR)
   - Comprehensive error-specific recommendation logic

### Files NOT Implemented (Due to Size Constraint)
3. **handler_test.go** (395 lines planned) - Handler test suite ❌ NOT STARTED
4. **detector_test.go additions** (285 lines planned) - Detector tests ❌ NOT STARTED

### Analysis
- **Original Plan**: ~756 lines total for Split 002
- **Actual Implementation**: 1061 lines for first 2 files only
- **Issue**: Files were more comprehensive than originally estimated
- **Logger**: 370 vs 232 planned (+138 lines)
- **Recommendations**: 691 vs 344 planned (+347 lines)
- **Total Overage**: +485 lines beyond original estimates

### Next Steps Required
1. ⚠️ **STOP IMMEDIATELY** per size limit rules
2. Request orchestrator to re-evaluate Split 002 plan
3. Options:
   - Create Sub-Split 002A (logger.go + reduced recommendations.go)
   - Create Sub-Split 002B (handler_test.go + detector_test.go)
   - OR reduce scope of recommendations.go significantly
4. Cannot continue with current plan without exceeding limits
