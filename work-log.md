  * ValidationError types
  * Enables seamless integration with certificate-validation-pipeline

### [2025-09-01 14:32] Test Suite Development
-  Comprehensive test coverage across all components:
  * detector_test.go: 7 test cases covering problem detection
  * recommender_test.go: 8 test cases covering recommendation generation
  * insecure_test.go: 10 test cases covering insecure mode functionality
-  Mock implementations for dependency injection
-  Error condition and edge case testing
-  **RESULT**: All 25 test cases passing

### [2025-09-01 14:34] Final Validation and Completion 
- **Line count verification**: 744 lines (within 800 limit) 
- **Test execution**: All 25 test cases passing 
