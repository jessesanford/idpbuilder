BUG-008 FIX COMPLETED
=====================

Bug ID: BUG-008
Severity: MEDIUM
Category: build_failure
Description: MockRegistry method visibility

Fix Applied:
------------
Exported MockRegistry state accessor methods to resolve visibility issues
during CASCADE layer 1 reintegration.

Changes Made:
-------------
File: pkg/testutils/mock_registry.go
- Added GetManifestCount() - exported method to get manifest count
- Added GetBlobCount() - exported method to get blob count
- Added GetTagCount() - exported method to get tag count
- Added GetImageCount() - exported method to get image count
- Added GetLayerCount() - exported method to get layer count

All methods:
- Properly exported (capitalized names)
- Thread-safe (use mutex locks)
- Follow Go conventions
- Enable external state inspection for assertions

Verification:
-------------
- Code builds successfully: go build ./pkg/testutils/...
- No compilation errors
- All new methods are exported and accessible
- Mutex synchronization ensures thread safety
