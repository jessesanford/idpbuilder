Commit: 6f94782e06e89d9d610a19dd16cca11408e0a1b3

FIXES APPLIED:
- ✅ Added missing TrustStoreManager interface to pkg/certs/types.go
- ✅ Added missing CertDiagnostics and ValidationError types
- ✅ All interface signatures now include registry parameter support
- ✅ Tests compile successfully (all 19 tests pass)
- ✅ Code compiles without errors
- ✅ Changes committed and pushed to remote

VERIFICATION:
- go build ./pkg/certs/... ✅ SUCCESS
- go test ./pkg/certs/... ✅ ALL TESTS PASS (19/19)

The certificate-validation-pipeline effort is now compatible with the
interface changes from registry-tls-trust-integration effort.

All required fixes from Phase Assessment Report have been implemented.
