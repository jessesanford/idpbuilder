Manager: software-factory-manager
Commit: 51262c4

## Executive Summary

Successfully strengthened R006 enforcement across all high-risk orchestrator states where code editing temptations are strongest. This prevents orchestrators from violating the cardinal rule that they are COORDINATORS ONLY, never developers.

## R006 Rule Overview

**Rule R006**: Orchestrator NEVER Writes, Measures, or Reviews Code
- **Criticality**: BLOCKING - Automatic termination
- **Penalty**: IMMEDIATE FAILURE (0% grade)
- **Location**: `/rule-library/R006-orchestrator-never-writes-code.md`

## States Updated

### 1. BACKPORT_FIXES
**Status**: ✅ Already had strong enforcement
- Already contained explicit R006 warnings
- Already emphasized spawning SW Engineers for all backporting
- No changes needed

### 2. FIX_BUILD_ISSUES
**Status**: ✅ Enhanced with R006 enforcement
**Changes Made**:
- Added R006 to PRIMARY DIRECTIVES section
- Added state-specific warning about fixing code directly
- Added R006 VIOLATION DETECTION section
- Emphasized spawning SW Engineers for ALL fixes

**Key Warning Added**:
```
DO NOT fix code issues yourself!
DO NOT use cherry-pick, apply patches, or make direct fixes!
Spawn SW Engineers for ALL code modifications
```

### 3. BUILD_VALIDATION
**Status**: ✅ Enhanced with R006 enforcement
**Changes Made**:
- Added R006 to PRIMARY DIRECTIVES section
- Added warning against fixing compilation errors
- Added R006 VIOLATION DETECTION section
- Clarified orchestrator only runs builds, never fixes

**Key Warning Added**:
```
DO NOT fix compilation errors yourself!
DO NOT edit code to make it compile!
If build fails, document issues for SW Engineers
```

### 4. INTEGRATION_TESTING
**Status**: ✅ Enhanced with R006 enforcement
**Changes Made**:
- Added R006 to PRIMARY DIRECTIVES section
- Added warning against resolving merge conflicts
- Updated Conflict Resolution Protocol to mandate SW Engineer intervention
- Expanded FORBIDDEN ACTIONS with R006 violations

**Key Warning Added**:
```
DO NOT resolve merge conflicts yourself!
DO NOT edit code to fix integration issues!
Document all issues for SW Engineers to resolve
```

### 5. PRODUCTION_READY_VALIDATION
**Status**: ✅ Enhanced with R006 enforcement
**Changes Made**:
- Added R006 to PRIMARY DIRECTIVES section
- Added warning against fixing test failures
- Added R006 VIOLATION DETECTION section
- Expanded FORBIDDEN ACTIONS with R006 specific violations

**Key Warning Added**:
```
DO NOT fix test failures yourself!
DO NOT modify code to make tests pass!
Document failures and spawn SW Engineers to fix them!
```

### 6. CREATE_INTEGRATION_TESTING
**Status**: ✅ Enhanced with R006 enforcement
**Changes Made**:
- Added R006 to PRIMARY DIRECTIVES section
- Created new CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS section with R006 detection
- Added FORBIDDEN ACTIONS section with R006 violations
- Clarified infrastructure setup vs code writing

**Key Warning Added**:
```
DO NOT create test files with code!
DO NOT write integration test implementations!
You create directories and infrastructure ONLY
```

### 7. PR_PLAN_CREATION
**Status**: ✅ Enhanced with R006 enforcement
**Changes Made**:
- Added R006 to PRIMARY DIRECTIVES section
- Added warning against last-minute fixes
- Added R006 VIOLATION DETECTION section
- Expanded FORBIDDEN ACTIONS with R006 violations

**Key Warning Added**:
```
DO NOT edit any code in PR descriptions!
DO NOT apply any last-minute fixes!
You only create the PR PLAN document - NEVER touch code
```

## Common Violation Patterns Addressed

### 1. The "Simplification" Excuse
**Pattern**: "Everything is already integrated, so I'll just apply the fixes"
**Prevention**: Explicit warnings that this is NEVER acceptable

### 2. The "Quick Fix" Temptation
**Pattern**: "It's just a small fix to make it compile"
**Prevention**: R006 VIOLATION DETECTION sections catch this

### 3. The "Infrastructure" Rationalization
**Pattern**: "I'm just setting up test infrastructure"
**Prevention**: Clear distinction between directories (allowed) and code (forbidden)

### 4. The "Merge Conflict" Trap
**Pattern**: "I need to resolve this conflict to continue"
**Prevention**: Mandatory SW Engineer spawning for ALL conflicts

## Enforcement Mechanisms

### 1. PRIMARY DIRECTIVES
Every state now has R006 as a mandatory rule to read, with file path specified

### 2. VIOLATION DETECTION
Each state has a section that lists specific actions that would violate R006

### 3. FORBIDDEN ACTIONS
Updated lists now explicitly call out R006 violations with -100% penalty

### 4. STATE-SPECIFIC WARNINGS
Tailored warnings for each state's unique temptations

## Impact

### Before These Changes:
- Orchestrators could rationalize code edits in integration states
- No explicit R006 references in many critical states
- Ambiguous whether certain actions violated R006

### After These Changes:
- Zero ambiguity about R006 enforcement
- State-specific warnings prevent excuses
- Clear detection patterns for violations
- Immediate failure consequences documented

## Verification

All changes have been:
- ✅ Written to disk using Edit tool
- ✅ Committed to git with descriptive message
- ✅ Pushed to remote repository
- ✅ TODO state saved for persistence

## Recommendations

1. **Monitor Compliance**: Watch for orchestrator violations in these states
2. **Update Training**: Ensure all orchestrator instances read updated rules
3. **Audit Regularly**: Check that R006 references remain synchronized
4. **Expand Coverage**: Consider adding R006 to remaining orchestrator states

## Conclusion

The Software Factory's orchestrator role is now strongly protected against the temptation to write code in integration-heavy states. The clear, explicit, and repeated R006 enforcement ensures orchestrators remain true to their coordination-only mandate.
