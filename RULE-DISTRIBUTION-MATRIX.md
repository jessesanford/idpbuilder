# ORCHESTRATOR RULE DISTRIBUTION MATRIX

## Overview
This matrix shows the current location of rules and their proposed new locations after optimization.

**Legend:**
- 游릭 Keep in bootstrap (orchestrator.md)
- 游댯 Move to specific states only
- 游리 Duplicate (keep in bootstrap + specific states)
- 游댮 Remove from bootstrap entirely

## Minimal Bootstrap Configuration

### Rules to Keep in orchestrator.md (7 rules + 1 reference)
```markdown
1. R283 - Complete File Reading (read files properly)
2. R290 - State Rule Reading (know to read state rules)
3. R203 - State-Aware Startup (startup sequence)
4. R206 - State Validation (validate transitions)
5. R288 - State File Updates (update state file)
6. R287 - TODO Persistence (recover from loss)
7. R322 - Stop Before Transitions (stop model)
8. SOFTWARE-FACTORY-STATE-MACHINE.md (state reference)
```

### Estimated Size Reduction
- Current orchestrator.md: 878 lines
- After migration: ~200 lines
- Reduction: 77%

## Validation Requirements

### For Bootstrap (orchestrator.md)
Must be able to:
- [ ] Determine current state from orchestrator-state.json
- [ ] Know to read state-specific rules (R290)
- [ ] Validate state transitions (R206)
- [ ] Update and persist state (R288)
- [ ] Recover from context loss (R287)
- [ ] Stop before transitions (R322)

### For Each State Directory
Must contain:
- [ ] All rules needed for that state's work
- [ ] Clear prerequisites from bootstrap
- [ ] Valid transition targets
- [ ] State-specific verification markers (R290)

## Testing Matrix

| Test Scenario | States to Test | Rules to Verify | Expected Result |
|---------------|----------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| Cold start | INIT | R203, R290, R281 | Loads state, creates file |
| Spawn operation | SPAWN_AGENTS | R208, R151 | Proper CD, timing |
| Monitoring | MONITOR_IMPLEMENTATION | R319, R006 | No code operations |
| Integration | INTEGRATION | R307, R280 | Branch protection |
| State transition | Any -> Any | R322, R288, R206 | Stop, update, validate |
| Recovery | Any | R287, R290 | TODO recovery, rule reload |

## Summary

### Total Rules to Migrate: 14 Supreme Laws + 6 Mandatory Rules = 20 rules
### Rules Staying in Bootstrap: 7 rules + 1 reference
### Rules Moving to States: 13 rules
### States Affected: All 67 states will be updated
### Expected Reduction: 77% fewer lines in orchestrator.md
### Risk Level: Medium (with proper testing)

This distribution ensures each state has exactly what it needs while keeping the bootstrap minimal but functional for state determination and rule loading.
