# Integration Plan - Phase 2 Wave 2
Date: 2025-09-05 20:38:00 UTC
Target Branch: idpbuilder-oci-go-cr/phase2/wave2-integration-20250905-201315
Base Branch: idpbuilder-oci-go-cr/phase2/wave1-integration-20250904-212505

## Branches to Integrate (ordered by lineage)
1. idpbuilder-oci-go-cr/phase2/wave2/cli-commands (parent: phase2/wave1-integration)

## Merge Strategy
- Single effort merge (Wave 2 contains only one effort)
- Based on Wave 1 integration (incremental development per R308)
- No conflicts expected (single branch merging to clean integration)
- Document all operations in work-log.md

## Expected Outcome
- Fully integrated CLI commands for build and push operations
- Integration with Wave 1 components (builder and registry client)
- No broken builds
- Complete documentation
- 800 lines added (at hard limit but within compliance)

## Validation Requirements
- Build must compile successfully
- All tests must pass
- Line count verification using line-counter.sh
- No upstream bugs to be fixed (document only per R266)

## Status
- COMPLETED: Merge executed successfully with conflict resolution
- Next: Build and test validation
