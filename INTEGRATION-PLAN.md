   - Dependencies: None
   - FIXES APPLIED: Duplicate removals
   
3. idpbuilder-oci-build-push/phase1/wave1/registry-auth-types-split-001 (E1.1.3-SPLIT-001)
   - Parent: main
   - Lines: 800
   - Dependencies: None
   - First part of registry-auth-types
   
4. idpbuilder-oci-build-push/phase1/wave1/registry-auth-types-split-002 (E1.1.3-SPLIT-002)

## Merge Strategy
- Use --no-edit flag for automatic merge commits
- Order based on git lineage and dependencies
- Split branches merged sequentially (001 before 002)
- No cherry-picking (R262 compliance)
- Preserve all commit history

## Expected Outcome
- Fully integrated branch with all 4 efforts
- All tests passing
- Clean build
- No duplicate definitions
- Properly consolidated TLSConfig
- Complete documentation trail

## R300 Compliance
This is a re-integration after fixes were applied directly to effort branches:
- registry-auth-types-split-002: Fixed TLSConfig consolidation issue
- registry-tls-trust: Fixed duplicate definition issues
- All fixes are in the source branches being merged
