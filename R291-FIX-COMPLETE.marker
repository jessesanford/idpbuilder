Branch: idpbuilder-push-oci/phase1/wave2/image-push-operations-split-002
Commit: 546bfb8

Fix Summary:
- Added extractImageNameFromTarball() helper function
- Modified loadTarballImage() to extract from manifest.json
- Preserves full registry/repo:tag reference from tarballs
- Fallback to filename if manifest parsing fails

Test Results:
- Build: SUCCESS
- All tests: PASS (19 tests)
- No regressions detected

Next Steps:
- This fix addresses the primary bug in split-002
- Split-003 (operations.go) requires complementary fix
- Integration cascade needed after both splits fixed
- R291 demo validation required after integration

Status: IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE - READY FOR INTEGRATION
