# Integration Demo Requirements and Fix Protocol Update Report

## Date: 2025-08-31
## Manager: software-factory-manager

## Executive Summary

Successfully updated the Software Factory integration rules to clarify that the demo is a **GATE** (not just documentation) and that all integration fixes **MUST** be made in effort branches (never directly in integration branches).

## Changes Implemented

### 1. Rule R291 Enhanced: Integration Demo Requirement

**Location**: `/home/vscode/software-factory-template/rule-library/R291-integration-demo-requirement.md`

#### Key Clarifications Added:

1. **Demo as Gate (Not Documentation)**:
   - Integration is NOT complete until demo passes
   - Demo must build successfully (no compilation errors)
   - Demo must run without errors (no runtime failures)
   - Demo must show features working (actual functionality)
   - All tests in demo must pass (zero test failures)

2. **Failed Demo Fix Protocol**:
   - Code Reviewer analyzes failures and creates FIX-INSTRUCTIONS.md
   - Orchestrator reads instructions and spawns SW Engineers
   - SW Engineers fix issues in EFFORT branches
   - Re-attempt integration with fixed code
   - Includes state machine for fix flow

### 2. New Rule R292 Created: Integration Fixes in Effort Branches

**Location**: `/home/vscode/software-factory-template/rule-library/R292-integration-fixes-in-effort-branches.md`

#### Critical Requirements:

1. **Absolute Requirement**:
   - ALL fixes MUST be in effort/feature branches
   - NEVER edit integration branch directly
   - NEVER commit fixes to integration branch

2. **Why This Matters**:
   - Ensures source branches stay correct
   - Makes future integrations work
   - Prevents drift between effort and integration branches
   - Maintains clean git history
   - Allows proper PR reviews
   - Enables rollback if needed

3. **Implementation Protocol**:
   - Identify failed integration
   - Trace failure to effort
   - Fix in effort branch
   - Re-integrate fixed effort

### 3. State Rules Updated

#### MONITORING_INTEGRATION State

**Location**: `/home/vscode/software-factory-template/agent-states/orchestrator/MONITORING_INTEGRATION/rules.md`

**Changes**:
- Added demo status checking per R291
- Integration blocked if demo not passing
- Triggers INTEGRATION_FEEDBACK_REVIEW for fixes
- References R291 and R292 in related rules

#### INTEGRATION_FEEDBACK_REVIEW State

**Location**: `/home/vscode/software-factory-template/agent-states/orchestrator/INTEGRATION_FEEDBACK_REVIEW/rules.md`

**Changes**:
- Added R291 and R292 to mandatory reading list
- Updated acknowledgment checklist (now 8 rules)
- Added demo failure handling context
- Updated expected report format to include demo status
- Added fix location requirements per R292

```

## Critical Points Now Enforced

### 1. Demo MUST Pass Before Integration Complete
- Integration is BLOCKED until demo works
- Failed demo = failed integration
- Must retry until demo passes
- This is a GATE, not documentation

### 2. Fix Flow for Failed Demos
- Code Reviewer creates FIX-INSTRUCTIONS.md
- Instructions go back to orchestrator
- Orchestrator spawns SW Engineers to fix issues
- Fixes MUST be in effort branches (R292)
- After fixes, re-attempt integration

### 3. Why Effort Branch Fixes are Mandatory
- Ensures source branches are correct
- Makes future integrations work
- Prevents drift between branches
- Maintains clean history
- Enables proper reviews
- Allows rollback

## Grading Impact

### Penalties for Violations:
- Demo not passing but marked complete: **-50% to -75%**
- Fixes made in integration branch: **-50%**
- Effort branches left broken: **-50%**
- Integration diverged from efforts: **-75%**
- Repeated violations: **-100% (FAIL)**

### Success Criteria:
- ✅ Demo builds, runs, and passes
- ✅ All fixes in effort branches
- ✅ Integration reflects fixed efforts
- ✅ No direct integration edits
- ✅ Clean merge history maintained

## Next Steps

1. **Agents Must Now**:
   - Check demo status before marking integration complete
   - Create FIX-INSTRUCTIONS.md for failures
   - Make all fixes in effort branches
   - Re-integrate after fixes

2. **System Enforcement**:
   - State machine blocks progression without passing demo
   - Orchestrator enforces effort branch fixes
   - Code Reviewer creates proper fix instructions
   - SW Engineers work only in effort branches

## Conclusion

The Software Factory now has crystal-clear requirements that:
1. Integration is NOT complete until the demo passes (it's a gate)
2. ALL fixes must be in effort branches (never integration)
3. The fix protocol ensures source branches stay correct

These changes prevent the common mistake of "patching" integration branches directly, which causes drift and future integration failures. The system now enforces proper CD practices where fixes flow from source to integration, not the reverse.
