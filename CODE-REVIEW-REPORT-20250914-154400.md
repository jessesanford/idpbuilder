## Size Analysis
- **Current Lines**: 542 (from line-counter.sh)
- **Limit**: 800 lines
- **Status**: COMPLIANT
- **Requires Split**: NO

## Split Integration Review
- ✅ **Properly builds on split-001**: Confirmed via git log
- ✅ **Branch ancestry correct**: Based on origin/idpbuilder-oci-build-push/phase2/wave1/gitea-client-split-001
- ✅ **No overlap with split-001**: Implementation focuses on push/list/retry/stubs as planned
- ✅ **Dependencies from split-001 available**: Can access Registry interface and auth types

## Functionality Review
- ✅ **Push Operations (push.go)**: Complete implementation with chunked uploads, progress tracking, and manifest handling
- ✅ **List Operations (list.go)**: Repository listing with pagination support implemented
- ✅ **Retry Logic (retry.go)**: Exponential backoff with configurable policies implemented
- ✅ **Test Stubs (stubs.go)**: Mock registry with error injection and delay simulation for testing
- ✅ **Requirements met**: All functionality specified in SPLIT-PLAN-002-GITEA.md is implemented
- ✅ **Edge cases handled**: Proper error handling, context cancellation, and cleanup
- ✅ **No stub implementations**: Verified no "TODO", "not implemented", or panic placeholders (R320 compliance)

## Code Quality
- ✅ **Clean, readable code**: Well-structured with clear method names
- ✅ **Proper variable naming**: Descriptive and consistent naming conventions
- ✅ **Appropriate comments**: Code is self-documenting with minimal but helpful comments
- ✅ **No code smells**: No obvious anti-patterns or bad practices detected
- ⚠️ **Minor formatting issues**: 10 files need gofmt formatting (non-blocking)

## Test Coverage
- **Unit Tests**: Present for auth and main gitea registry
- **Integration Tests**: Basic integration tests passing
- **Test Quality**: Tests are passing and cover main paths
- ⚠️ **Missing tests for split-002 specific files**: No dedicated tests for push.go, list.go, retry.go (should be addressed but non-blocking)

## Pattern Compliance
- ✅ **Go patterns followed**: Idiomatic Go code with proper interfaces
- ✅ **API conventions correct**: HTTP client usage follows best practices
- ✅ **Error handling patterns**: Consistent error wrapping and propagation
- ✅ **Context handling**: Proper context propagation for cancellation

## Security Review
- ✅ **No security vulnerabilities detected**: No SQL injection, command execution, or path traversal risks
- ✅ **Input validation present**: Proper validation in list operations
- ✅ **Authentication handled**: Auth headers properly set when available
- ✅ **No hardcoded credentials**: All auth managed through auth manager
- ✅ **Safe HTTP operations**: Proper request construction with context

## Build and Compilation
- ✅ **Code compiles successfully**: `go build ./pkg/registry/...` succeeds
- ✅ **No vet issues**: `go vet` passes without errors
- ✅ **Tests pass**: All existing tests passing

## Issues Found
1. **Minor - Code Formatting**: Some files need gofmt formatting (non-blocking)
2. **Minor - Test Coverage**: Split-002 specific files (push.go, list.go, retry.go) lack dedicated unit tests (non-blocking for split work)

## Recommendations
1. Run `gofmt -w pkg/registry/` to fix formatting
2. Add unit tests for push.go, list.go, and retry.go in future iterations
3. Consider adding integration tests specifically for retry logic scenarios
4. Document the chunked upload size configuration for performance tuning

## Next Steps
**APPROVED**: Ready for integration into the main effort branch. The implementation successfully completes Split-002 of the gitea-client effort with all core functionality working correctly and within size limits.

## Compliance Verification
- ✅ **R304 Compliance**: Used tools/line-counter.sh exclusively for measurement
- ✅ **R338 Compliance**: Standardized SIZE MEASUREMENT REPORT format included
- ✅ **R320 Compliance**: No stub implementations found
- ✅ **R307 Compliance**: Code independently mergeable with proper feature boundaries
- ✅ **Size Limit Compliance**: 542 lines < 800 line limit
