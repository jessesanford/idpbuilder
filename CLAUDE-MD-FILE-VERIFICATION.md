## Summary

### Total File Accountability:
- **13 Critical Protocol Files**: All created in `/protocols/`
- **15 Optional Enhancement Files**: All created in `/possibly-needed-but-not-sure/`
- **4 Agent Configurations**: All generalized in `/.claude/agents/`
- **1 Command**: Created in `/.claude/commands/`
- **2 Core Files**: Created in `/core/`
- **1 Tool**: Generalized in `/tools/`

### Files Referenced in CLAUDE.md:
- ✅ **100% of critical files** are present
- ✅ **100% of optional files** are available
- ✅ **All path references** updated to template structure
- ✅ **All TMC/KCP specific** references generalized

### Critical Discoveries:
1. **SW-ENGINEER-EXPLICIT-INSTRUCTIONS.md** - Was missing, now added
2. **CODE-REVIEWER-COMPREHENSIVE-GUIDE.md** - Was in possibly-needed as EXAMPLE, moved to protocols
3. **TODO-STATE-MANAGEMENT-PROTOCOL.md** - Was in possibly-needed, moved to protocols

### Template CLAUDE.md Updates:
- ✅ All file paths updated to correct template locations
- ✅ `/orchestrator/` references changed to `/protocols/` where appropriate
- ✅ `/orchestrator/SOFTWARE-FACTORY-STATE-MACHINE.md` changed to `/core/`
- ✅ Agent file references updated to generic names
- ✅ Tool path updated to `/tools/line-counter.sh`

## Verification Complete ✅

All files referenced in the original CLAUDE.md have been accounted for in the software-factory-template, either as:
1. Core required files in `/protocols/`
2. Optional files in `/possibly-needed-but-not-sure/`
3. Runtime files created during execution
4. Template/example files for user customization

The template is complete and all references are valid.
