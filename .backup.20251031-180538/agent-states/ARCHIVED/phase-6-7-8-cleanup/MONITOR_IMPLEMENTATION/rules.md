# Orchestrator - MONITORING_SWE_PROGRESS State Rules


## 🟢🟢🟢 NORMAL MONITORING_SWE_PROGRESS TRANSITIONS - CONTINUE AUTOMATICALLY! 🟢🟢🟢

**Per R322: Monitoring states require stops for context preservation, but use TRUE flag for normal operations**

### IMPORTANT CLARIFICATION FROM R322:
**Monitoring states accumulate context from agent outputs - stops are needed to preserve this context**

### MANDATORY STOP PROTOCOL:
1. ✅ Complete all monitoring tasks for this state
2. ✅ Update orchestrator-state-v3.json with new state
3. ✅ Commit and push the state file
4. ✅ Output CONTINUE-SOFTWARE-FACTORY=TRUE (for normal operations)
5. ✅ **STOP PROCESSING** (mandatory for context preservation)

### YOU SHOULD:
- ✅ Monitor agent progress as required
- ✅ Determine next appropriate state
- ✅ Update state file and continue
- ✅ Enable automation to proceed

### DO NOT STOP FOR:
- ❌ "Milestone reached" - This is NORMAL operation
- ❌ "Important transition" - Monitoring→spawning is ROUTINE
- ❌ "User review" - Automation should continue
- ❌ "Being cautious" - Trust the automation

### AUTOMATION CONTINUITY:
```bash
# When monitoring shows agents are done:
echo "✅ Agents have completed implementation"
echo "➡️ Transitioning to SPAWN_CODE_REVIEWERS_EFFORT_REVIEW"
echo "CONTINUE-SOFTWARE-FACTORY=TRUE"  # Enable automation!
```

**MONITORING_SWE_PROGRESS IS NORMAL - KEEP THE FACTORY RUNNING!**

## 🔴🔴🔴 R290 ENFORCEMENT: READ THESE RULES FIRST! 🔴🔴🔴

**SUPREME LAW #3 (R290): STATE RULES MUST BE READ BEFORE STATE ACTIONS**

## 🔴🔴🔴 STOP! STATE RULE READING IS ABSOLUTELY FIRST! 🔴🔴🔴

**YOU HAVE ENTERED MONITORING_SWE_PROGRESS STATE - YOU MUST READ AND ACKNOWLEDGE ALL STATE RULES BEFORE DOING ANY STATE WORK!**

## 🔴🔴🔴 R290 VERIFICATION REQUIREMENT 🔴🔴🔴

**R290 ENFORCEMENT: CREATE VERIFICATION MARKER AFTER READING**

After reading and acknowledging all state rules, you MUST create a verification marker:

```bash
# MANDATORY: Create verification marker after reading rules
touch .state_rules_read_orchestrator_MONITORING_SWE_PROGRESS
echo "$(date +%s) - Rules read and acknowledged for MONITORING_SWE_PROGRESS" > .state_rules_read_orchestrator_MONITORING_SWE_PROGRESS
```

**FAILURE TO CREATE MARKER = AUTOMATIC -100% PENALTY**

## 📋 PRIMARY DIRECTIVES FOR MONITORING_SWE_PROGRESS STATE

### Core Mandatory Rules

**Criticality**: BLOCKING - Verify all work locations
**Summary**: Confirm agents worked in correct directories and branches

## 🔴🔴🔴 CRITICAL: MONITORING_SWE_PROGRESS IS A VERB - START MONITORING_SWE_PROGRESS IMPLEMENTATIONS NOW! 🔴🔴🔴

**MONITORING_SWE_PROGRESS MEANS ACTIVELY MONITORING_SWE_PROGRESS IMPLEMENTATIONS RIGHT NOW!**
- ❌ NOT "I'm in monitor implementation state"  
- ❌ NOT "Ready to monitor implementations"
- ✅ YES "I'm checking SW Engineer E3.1.2 progress NOW"
- ✅ YES "I'm verifying implementation in E3.1.3 NOW"
- ✅ YES "I'm detecting implementation completion NOW"

## State Context
MONITORING_SWE_PROGRESS = You ARE ACTIVELY monitoring spawned SW Engineers implementing features THIS INSTANT. Focus specifically on implementation progress, not reviews or fixes.

## 🚨🚨🚨 IMMEDIATE ACTIONS UPON ENTERING MONITORING_SWE_PROGRESS STATE 🚨🚨🚨

**THE INSTANT YOU ENTER MONITORING_SWE_PROGRESS STATE, DO THIS:**

```bash
# ✅ CORRECT - IMMEDIATE ACTION
echo "🔍 MONITORING_SWE_PROGRESS IMPLEMENTATIONS: Checking all active SW Engineers NOW..."

# Step 1: List all SW Engineers being monitored (DO NOW!)
echo "📊 Active SW Engineers under monitoring:"
for effort in $(echo "✅ State file updated to: $NEXT_STATE"
```

---

### ✅ Step 4: Validate State File (R324)
```bash
# Validate state file before committing
"$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/tools/validate-state.sh" orchestrator-state-v3.json || {
    echo "❌ State file validation failed!"
    exit 288
}
echo "✅ State file validated"
```

---

### ✅ Step 5: Commit State File (R288)
```bash
# Commit and push state file immediately
git add orchestrator-state-v3.json
git commit -m "state: MONITORING_SWE_PROGRESS → $NEXT_STATE - MONITORING_SWE_PROGRESS complete [R288]"
git push
echo "✅ State file committed and pushed"
```

---

### ✅ Step 6: Save TODOs (R287 - SUPREME LAW)
```bash
# Save TODO state before transition (R287 trigger)
save_todos "MONITORING_SWE_PROGRESS_COMPLETE"

# Commit TODOs within 60 seconds (R287)
cd "$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR"
git add todos/*.todo
git commit -m "todo: orchestrator - MONITORING_SWE_PROGRESS complete [R287]"
git push
echo "✅ TODOs saved and committed"
```

---

### ✅ Step 7: Output Continuation Flag (R405 - SUPREME LAW) ⚠️ MANDATORY
```bash
# Output continuation flag as LAST action (R405)
# Use TRUE for normal completion, FALSE only for catastrophic errors

echo "CONTINUE-SOFTWARE-FACTORY=TRUE"
```

**⚠️ THIS MUST BE THE ABSOLUTE LAST LINE OF OUTPUT BEFORE EXIT! ⚠️**

---

### ✅ Step 8: Stop Processing (R322 - SUPREME LAW)
```bash
# Stop for context preservation (R322)
echo "🛑 Stopping for context preservation - use /continue-orchestrating to resume"
exit 0
```

---

## 🚨 CHECKLIST ENFORCEMENT 🚨

**Skipping ANY step in this checklist = FAILURE:**
- Missing Step 2: No next state = stuck forever
- Missing Step 3: No state update = state machine broken (R288 violation, -100%)
- Missing Step 4: Invalid state = corruption (R324 violation)
- Missing Step 5: No commit = state lost on compaction (R288 violation, -100%)
- Missing Step 6: No TODO save = work lost (R287 violation, -20% to -100%)
- Missing Step 7: No continuation flag = automation stops (R405 violation, -100%)
- Missing Step 8: No exit = R322 violation (-100%)

**ALL 8 STEPS ARE MANDATORY - NO EXCEPTIONS**

## 🔴🔴🔴 R405 - MANDATORY AUTOMATION CONTINUATION FLAG 🔴🔴🔴

**SUPREME LAW - PENALTY FOR VIOLATION: -100% GRADE**


### 🚨 CRITICAL DISTINCTION: AGENT STOPS ≠ FACTORY STOPS 🚨

**TWO INDEPENDENT DECISIONS - DO NOT CONFUSE THEM:**

#### 1. Should Agent Stop Work? (R322 Technical Requirement)
- Agent completes current state
- Agent saves TODOs and commits state
- Agent exits with `exit 0` (preserves context)
- User runs /continue-orchestrating to resume
- **This is NORMAL at checkpoints**

#### 2. Should Factory Continue? (R405 Operational Status)
- Even though agent stopped, can automation proceed?
- TRUE = Healthy completion, automation can continue
- FALSE = Catastrophic failure, must halt everything
- **R322 checkpoints = TRUE (99.9% of cases)**

### THE PATTERN AT R322 CHECKPOINTS (SF 3.0)

```bash
# 1. Complete state work
echo "✅ State work complete"

# 2. Set proposed next state
PROPOSED_NEXT_STATE="NEXT_STATE"
TRANSITION_REASON="State work complete"

# 3. Spawn State Manager for state transition
/spawn state-manager SHUTDOWN_CONSULTATION \
  --current-state "CURRENT_STATE" \
  --proposed-next-state "$PROPOSED_NEXT_STATE" \
  --transition-reason "$TRANSITION_REASON"
# State Manager updates all 4 state files atomically

# 4. Save TODOs
save_todos "R322_CHECKPOINT"

# 5. Factory continues (operational status)
echo "CONTINUE-SOFTWARE-FACTORY=TRUE"

# 6. Agent stops (technical requirement)
exit 0
```

**Both happen together! Agent stops AND factory continues!**

### WHEN TO USE EACH FLAG VALUE

**TRUE (99.9%):**
- ✅ R322 checkpoint reached
- ✅ State work completed successfully
- ✅ Ready for /continue-orchestrating
- ✅ Waiting for user to continue (NORMAL)
- ✅ Plan ready for review (agent done, factory proceeds)

**FALSE (0.1%):**
- ❌ CATASTROPHIC unrecoverable error
- ❌ Data corruption spreading
- ❌ Critical security violation
- ❌ NOT for R322 checkpoints
- ❌ NOT for user review needs
### 🚨 MONITORING_SWE_PROGRESS STATE PATTERN - NORMAL TRANSITIONS 🚨

**Monitoring states transition to next actions automatically:**
```bash
# After monitoring completes
echo "✅ Monitoring complete, agents finished work"

# Determine next action from results
if all_succeeded; then
    transition_to "SPAWN_CODE_REVIEWERS_EFFORT_REVIEW"
elif needs_fixes; then
    transition_to "SPAWN_SW_ENGINEERS"
fi

# R322 checkpoint (if required by this transition)
echo "CONTINUE-SOFTWARE-FACTORY=TRUE"  # NORMAL operation!
exit 0  # If R322 checkpoint
```

**Why TRUE is correct:**
- Monitoring results drive automatic actions
- System knows what to do based on results
- **Review findings = Spawn fixes = NORMAL!**
