# Orchestrator - MONITORING_INTEGRATE_WAVE_EFFORTS State Rules


## 🔴🔴🔴 MANDATORY STATE RULE READING AND ACKNOWLEDGMENT 🔴🔴🔴

### ⚠️⚠️⚠️ YOU MUST READ EACH RULE FILE LISTED IN PRIMARY DIRECTIVES. **I AM WATCHING YOUR TOOL CALLS FOR READ OPERATIONS** *YOU WILL FAIL* IF YOU DO NOT MAKE A READ FILE CALL FOR EACH RULE FILE IN PRIMARY DIRECTIVES!!! ⚠️⚠️⚠️

**AFTER READING, YOU MUST ACKNOWLEDGE ALL THE STATE RULES AND STATE THAT YOU WILL ABIDE BY THEM ONE AT A TIME GIVING THE RULE NUMBER AND DESCRIPTION.**

## 📋 PRIMARY DIRECTIVES FOR MONITORING_INTEGRATE_WAVE_EFFORTS STATE

### Core Mandatory Rules (ALL orchestrator states must have these):

1. **🚨🚨🚨 R006** - ORCHESTRATOR NEVER WRITES CODE OR PERFORMS FILE OPERATIONS (BLOCKING)
   - File: `$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/rule-library/R006-orchestrator-never-writes-code.md`
   - Criticality: BLOCKING - Automatic termination, 0% grade
   - Summary: NEVER write, copy, move, or manipulate ANY code files - delegate ALL to agents

2. **🔴🔴🔴 R287** - TODO PERSISTENCE COMPREHENSIVE (SUPREME LAW)
   - File: `$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/rule-library/R287-todo-persistence-comprehensive.md`
   - Criticality: SUPREME - -20% to -100% penalty for violations
   - Summary: MUST save TODOs within 30s after write, every 10 messages, before transitions

3. **🔴🔴🔴 R288** - STATE FILE UPDATE REQUIREMENTS (SUPREME LAW)
   - File: `$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/rule-library/R288-state-file-update-and-commit-protocol.md`
   - Criticality: SUPREME - State updates required for all transitions
   - Summary: MUST update orchestrator-state-v3.json before EVERY state transition

4. **🔴🔴🔴 R322 Part A** - Mandatory Stop After Spawn States
   - File: `$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/rule-library/R322-mandatory-stop-before-state-transitions.md`
   - Criticality: SUPREME LAW - Must stop after spawning
   - Summary: ALL spawn states require STOP after spawning agents

### State-Specific Rules:

5. **🔴🔴🔴 R233** - Immediate Action On State Entry
   - File: `$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/rule-library/R233-all-states-immediate-action.md`
   - Criticality: SUPREME LAW - Must act immediately on entering state
   - Summary: Monitoring states require active checking, not passive waiting

6. **🔴🔴🔴 R358** - Integration Completion Detection and Automatic Transition
   - File: `$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/rule-library/R358-integration-completion-detection.md`
   - Criticality: SUPREME LAW - Must detect completion and transition within 30 seconds
   - Summary: CANNOT remain in MONITORING_INTEGRATE_WAVE_EFFORTS after integration completes

## 🔴🔴🔴 R358 INTEGRATE_WAVE_EFFORTS COMPLETION MONITORING_SWE_PROGRESS STARTUP 🔴🔴🔴

**MANDATORY**: When entering MONITORING_INTEGRATE_WAVE_EFFORTS state:

```bash
# START THE R358 MONITORING_SWE_PROGRESS LOOP IMMEDIATELY
echo "📊 Entering MONITORING_INTEGRATE_WAVE_EFFORTS state - starting R358 monitoring loop"

# Start the completion detection function
monitor_integration_completion &
MONITOR_PID=$!

echo "✅ R358 monitoring loop started (PID: $MONITOR_PID)"
echo "Will check for completion every 30 seconds and transition immediately when detected"
```

**NEVER** just wait passively - the monitoring must be ACTIVE and CONTINUOUS!

## 🛑🛑🛑 R322 MANDATORY STOP BEFORE STATE TRANSITIONS 🛑🛑🛑

**SUPREME LAW - VIOLATION = -100% IMMEDIATE FAILURE**

### YOU MUST STOP AFTER:
1. ✅ Completing all TODOs for this state
2. ✅ Updating orchestrator-state-v3.json with new state
3. ✅ Committing and pushing the state file  
4. ✅ Providing work summary

### YOU MUST NOT:
- ❌ Continue to the next state automatically
- ❌ Start work for the new state
- ❌ Spawn agents for the new state
- ❌ Assume permission to continue

### STOP PROTOCOL:
```markdown
## 🛑 STATE TRANSITION CHECKPOINT: CURRENT_STATE → NEXT_STATE

### ✅ Current State Work Completed:
- [List completed work]

### 📊 Current Status:
- Current State: CURRENT_STATE
- Next State: NEXT_STATE
- TODOs Completed: X/Y
- State Files: Updated and committed ✅

### ⏸️ STOPPED - Awaiting User Continuation
Ready to transition to NEXT_STATE. Please use /continue-orchestrating.
```

**STOP MEANS STOP - Exit and wait for /continue-orchestrating**

# ORCHESTRATOR STATE: MONITORING_INTEGRATE_WAVE_EFFORTS

## 🔴🔴🔴 SUPREME DIRECTIVE: INTEGRATE_WAVE_EFFORTS FEEDBACK ENFORCEMENT 🔴🔴🔴

**YOU MUST CHECK FOR INTEGRATE_WAVE_EFFORTS REPORTS AND ACT ON FAILURES!**

## State Overview

In MONITORING_INTEGRATE_WAVE_EFFORTS, you are monitoring the Integration Agent's progress and MUST check for integration reports to determine next state.

## Required Actions

### 1. Monitor Integration Agent Progress with R358 Enforcement

#### 🔴🔴🔴 R358: CONTINUOUS COMPLETION DETECTION REQUIRED 🔴🔴🔴

**MUST check for integration completion every 30 seconds and transition IMMEDIATELY!**

```bash
# R358 ENFORCEMENT: Continuous completion detection loop
monitor_integration_completion() {
    while true; do
        # Check every 30 seconds per R358
        sleep 30

        # Method 1: Check integration_status in state file
        INTEGRATE_WAVE_EFFORTS_STATUS=$(echo "✅ State file updated to: $NEXT_STATE"
```

---

### ✅ Step 4: Validate State File (R324)
```bash
# Validate state file before committing
"$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/tools/validate-state.sh" orchestrator-state-v3.json || {
    echo "❌ State file validation failed!"
    exit 288
}
echo "✅ State file validated"
```

---

### ✅ Step 5: Commit State File (R288)
```bash
# Commit and push state file immediately
git add orchestrator-state-v3.json
git commit -m "state: MONITORING_INTEGRATE_WAVE_EFFORTS → $NEXT_STATE - MONITORING_INTEGRATE_WAVE_EFFORTS complete [R288]"
git push
echo "✅ State file committed and pushed"
```

---

### ✅ Step 6: Save TODOs (R287 - SUPREME LAW)
```bash
# Save TODO state before transition (R287 trigger)
save_todos "MONITORING_INTEGRATE_WAVE_EFFORTS_COMPLETE"

# Commit TODOs within 60 seconds (R287)
cd "$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR"
git add todos/*.todo
git commit -m "todo: orchestrator - MONITORING_INTEGRATE_WAVE_EFFORTS complete [R287]"
git push
echo "✅ TODOs saved and committed"
```

---

### ✅ Step 7: Output Continuation Flag (R405 - SUPREME LAW) ⚠️ MANDATORY
```bash
# Output continuation flag as LAST action (R405)
# Use TRUE for normal completion, FALSE only for catastrophic errors

echo "CONTINUE-SOFTWARE-FACTORY=TRUE"
```

**⚠️ THIS MUST BE THE ABSOLUTE LAST LINE OF OUTPUT BEFORE EXIT! ⚠️**

---

### ✅ Step 8: Stop Processing (R322 - SUPREME LAW)
```bash
# Stop for context preservation (R322)
echo "🛑 Stopping for context preservation - use /continue-orchestrating to resume"
exit 0
```

---

## 🚨 CHECKLIST ENFORCEMENT 🚨

**Skipping ANY step in this checklist = FAILURE:**
- Missing Step 2: No next state = stuck forever
- Missing Step 3: No state update = state machine broken (R288 violation, -100%)
- Missing Step 4: Invalid state = corruption (R324 violation)
- Missing Step 5: No commit = state lost on compaction (R288 violation, -100%)
- Missing Step 6: No TODO save = work lost (R287 violation, -20% to -100%)
- Missing Step 7: No continuation flag = automation stops (R405 violation, -100%)
- Missing Step 8: No exit = R322 violation (-100%)

**ALL 8 STEPS ARE MANDATORY - NO EXCEPTIONS**

## 🔴🔴🔴 R405 - MANDATORY AUTOMATION CONTINUATION FLAG 🔴🔴🔴

**SUPREME LAW - PENALTY FOR VIOLATION: -100% GRADE**


### 🚨 CRITICAL DISTINCTION: AGENT STOPS ≠ FACTORY STOPS 🚨

**TWO INDEPENDENT DECISIONS - DO NOT CONFUSE THEM:**

#### 1. Should Agent Stop Work? (R322 Technical Requirement)
- Agent completes current state
- Agent saves TODOs and commits state
- Agent exits with `exit 0` (preserves context)
- User runs /continue-orchestrating to resume
- **This is NORMAL at checkpoints**

#### 2. Should Factory Continue? (R405 Operational Status)
- Even though agent stopped, can automation proceed?
- TRUE = Healthy completion, automation can continue
- FALSE = Catastrophic failure, must halt everything
- **R322 checkpoints = TRUE (99.9% of cases)**

### THE PATTERN AT R322 CHECKPOINTS (SF 3.0)

```bash
# 1. Complete state work
echo "✅ State work complete"

# 2. Set proposed next state
PROPOSED_NEXT_STATE="NEXT_STATE"
TRANSITION_REASON="State work complete"

# 3. Spawn State Manager for state transition
/spawn state-manager SHUTDOWN_CONSULTATION \
  --current-state "CURRENT_STATE" \
  --proposed-next-state "$PROPOSED_NEXT_STATE" \
  --transition-reason "$TRANSITION_REASON"
# State Manager updates all 4 state files atomically

# 4. Save TODOs
save_todos "R322_CHECKPOINT"

# 5. Factory continues (operational status)
echo "CONTINUE-SOFTWARE-FACTORY=TRUE"

# 6. Agent stops (technical requirement)
exit 0
```

**Both happen together! Agent stops AND factory continues!**

### WHEN TO USE EACH FLAG VALUE

**TRUE (99.9%):**
- ✅ R322 checkpoint reached
- ✅ State work completed successfully
- ✅ Ready for /continue-orchestrating
- ✅ Waiting for user to continue (NORMAL)
- ✅ Plan ready for review (agent done, factory proceeds)

**FALSE (0.1%):**
- ❌ CATASTROPHIC unrecoverable error
- ❌ Data corruption spreading
- ❌ Critical security violation
- ❌ NOT for R322 checkpoints
- ❌ NOT for user review needs
### 🚨 MONITORING_SWE_PROGRESS STATE PATTERN - NORMAL TRANSITIONS 🚨

**Monitoring states transition to next actions automatically:**
```bash
# After monitoring completes
echo "✅ Monitoring complete, agents finished work"

# Determine next action from results
if all_succeeded; then
    transition_to "SPAWN_CODE_REVIEWERS_EFFORT_REVIEW"
elif needs_fixes; then
    transition_to "SPAWN_SW_ENGINEERS"
fi

# R322 checkpoint (if required by this transition)
echo "CONTINUE-SOFTWARE-FACTORY=TRUE"  # NORMAL operation!
exit 0  # If R322 checkpoint
```

**Why TRUE is correct:**
- Monitoring results drive automatic actions
- System knows what to do based on results
- **Review findings = Spawn fixes = NORMAL!**
**See: $CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/rule-library/R405-automation-continuation-flag.md**

- R358: Integration Completion Detection (SUPREME - must detect and transition immediately)
- R321: Immediate Backport During Integration (for failures)
- R291: Integration Demo Requirement (CRITICAL - demo must pass)

## 🔴🔴🔴 MANDATORY MEASUREMENT RULE - R304 🔴🔴🔴

**ABSOLUTE REQUIREMENTS:**
- ✅ MUST use `$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/tools/line-counter.sh` for ALL line counting
- ❌ NEVER use `wc -l` or any manual counting method
- ❌ NEVER count lines any other way - this is a -100% automatic failure
- ✅ MUST specify both -b (base branch) and -c (current branch) parameters
- ✅ Base branch MUST be phase integration branch (NOT "main")

**Failure to use the line counter tool = AUTOMATIC -100% GRADE**

## R322 VIOLATION DETECTION

If you find yourself:
- Starting work for a new state without /continue-orchestrating
- Transitioning without stopping after state file commit
- Continuing after completing state work

**STOP IMMEDIATELY - You are violating R322!**


### 🔴🔴🔴 MANDATORY VALIDATION REQUIREMENT 🔴🔴🔴

**Per R288 and R324**: ALL state file updates MUST be validated before commit:

```bash
# After ANY update to orchestrator-state-v3.json:
"$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/tools/validate-state.sh" orchestrator-state-v3.json || {
    echo "❌ State file validation failed!"
    exit 288
}
```

**Use helper functions for automatic validation:**
```bash
# Source the helper functions
source "$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/utilities/state-file-update-functions.sh"

# Use safe functions that include validation:
safe_state_transition "NEW_STATE" "reason"
safe_update_field "field_name" "value"
```
