# Orchestrator - DISTRIBUTE_FIX_PLANS State Rules

## üõëüõëüõë R322 MANDATORY STOP BEFORE STATE TRANSITIONS üõëüõëüõë

**SUPREME LAW - VIOLATION = -100% IMMEDIATE FAILURE**

### YOU MUST STOP AFTER:
1. ‚úÖ Completing all TODOs for this state
2. ‚úÖ Updating orchestrator-state.yaml with new state
3. ‚úÖ Committing and pushing the state file  
4. ‚úÖ Providing work summary

## üõë STATE TRANSITION CHECKPOINT: CURRENT_STATE ‚Üí NEXT_STATE

### ‚úÖ Current State Work Completed:
- [List completed work]

### üìä Current Status:
- Current State: CURRENT_STATE
- Next State: NEXT_STATE
- TODOs Completed: X/Y
- State Files: Updated and committed ‚úÖ

### ‚è∏Ô∏è STOPPED - Awaiting User Continuation
Ready to transition to NEXT_STATE. Please use /continue-orchestrating.
```

**STOP MEANS STOP - Exit and wait for /continue-orchestrating**

## üî¥üî¥üî¥ R290 ENFORCEMENT: READ THESE RULES FIRST! üî¥üî¥üî¥

**SUPREME LAW #3 (R290): STATE RULES MUST BE READ BEFORE STATE ACTIONS**

## üî¥üî¥üî¥ STOP! STATE RULE READING IS ABSOLUTELY FIRST! üî¥üî¥üî¥

**YOU HAVE ENTERED DISTRIBUTE_FIX_PLANS STATE - YOU MUST READ AND ACKNOWLEDGE ALL STATE RULES BEFORE DOING ANY STATE WORK!**

## üî¥üî¥üî¥ R290 VERIFICATION REQUIREMENT üî¥üî¥üî¥

**R290 ENFORCEMENT: CREATE VERIFICATION MARKER AFTER READING**

After reading and acknowledging all state rules, you MUST create a verification marker:

```bash
# MANDATORY: Create verification marker after reading rules
touch .state_rules_read_orchestrator_DISTRIBUTE_FIX_PLANS
echo "$(date +%s) - Rules read and acknowledged for DISTRIBUTE_FIX_PLANS" > .state_rules_read_orchestrator_DISTRIBUTE_FIX_PLANS
```

**FAILURE TO CREATE MARKER = AUTOMATIC -100% PENALTY**

The system will check for this marker. No marker = Immediate failure.

### ‚ùå DO NOT DO ANY DISTRIBUTION WORK UNTIL RULES ARE READ:
- ‚ùå Load fix plan summaries
- ‚ùå Copy plans to directories
- ‚ùå Create marker files
- ‚ùå Update state files
- ‚ùå Continue to next state
- ‚ùå Think about what to do in this state

### ‚úÖ YOU MUST IMMEDIATELY:

## üî¥üî¥üî¥ MANDATORY STATE RULE READING AND ACKNOWLEDGMENT üî¥üî¥üî¥

### ‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è YOU MUST READ EACH RULE FILE LISTED IN PRIMARY DIRECTIVES. **I AM WATCHING YOUR TOOL CALLS FOR READ OPERATIONS** *YOU WILL FAIL* IF YOU DO NOT MAKE A READ FILE CALL FOR EACH RULE FILE IN PRIMARY DIRECTIVES!!! ‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è

**AFTER READING, YOU MUST ACKNOWLEDGE ALL THE STATE RULES AND STATE THAT YOU WILL ABIDE BY THEM ONE AT A TIME GIVING THE RULE NUMBER AND DESCRIPTION.**

### PRIMARY DIRECTIVES - MANDATORY READING:

### üõë RULE R322 - Mandatory Stop Before State Transitions
**Source:** $CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/rule-library/R322-mandatory-stop-before-state-transitions.md
**Criticality:** üî¥üî¥üî¥ SUPREME LAW - Violation = -100% FAILURE

After completing state work and committing state file:
1. STOP IMMEDIATELY
2. Do NOT continue to next state
3. Do NOT start new work
4. Exit and wait for user

**USE THESE EXACT READ COMMANDS (IN THIS ORDER):**
1. Read: $CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/rule-library/R234-mandatory-state-traversal-supreme-law.md
2. Read: $CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/rule-library/R006-orchestrator-never-writes-code.md
3. Read: $CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/rule-library/R290-state-rule-reading-verification-supreme-law.md
5. Read: $CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/rule-library/R239-fix-plan-distribution.md
6. Read: $CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/rule-library/R209-effort-directory-isolation-protocol.md
7. Read: $CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/rule-library/R194-remote-branch-tracking.md
8. Read: $CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/rule-library/R206-state-machine-transition-validation.md

**WE ARE WATCHING EACH READ TOOL CALL**

### ‚ùå ANTI-PATTERNS THAT WILL CAUSE FAILURE:

1. **Fake Acknowledgment Without Reading**:
   ```
   ‚ùå WRONG: "I acknowledge R234, R208, R290..."
   (No Read tool calls detected = AUTOMATIC FAILURE)
   ```

2. **Bulk Acknowledgment**:
   ```
   ‚ùå WRONG: "I acknowledge all DISTRIBUTE_FIX_PLANS rules"
   (YOU Must READ AND ACKNOWLEDGE EACH rule individually)
   ```

3. **Silent Reading**:
   ```
   ‚ùå WRONG: [Reads rules but doesn't acknowledge]
   "Now I've read the rules, let me start work..."
   (MUST explicitly acknowledge EACH rule)
   ```

4. **Reading From Memory**:
   ```
   ‚ùå WRONG: "I know R239 requires distribution..."
   (Must READ from file, not recall from memory)
   ```

5. **Skipping Rules in PRIMARY DIRECTIVES**:
   ```
   ‚ùå WRONG: Reading only some rules from the list
   (ALL rules in PRIMARY DIRECTIVES are MANDATORY)
   ```

### ‚úÖ CORRECT PATTERN FOR DISTRIBUTE_FIX_PLANS:
```
1. READ: $CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/rule-library/R234-mandatory-state-traversal-supreme-law.md
2. "I acknowledge R234 - Mandatory State Traversal: [Brief description]"
3. READ: $CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/rule-library/R006-orchestrator-never-writes-code.md  
4. "I acknowledge R006 - Orchestrator Never Writes Code: [Brief description]"
[Continue for EVERY rule in PRIMARY DIRECTIVES...]
5. Create verification marker
6. "Ready to execute DISTRIBUTE_FIX_PLANS work"
```

### üö® NO WORK UNTIL ACKNOWLEDGMENT COMPLETE üö®
**You may NOT begin ANY DISTRIBUTE_FIX_PLANS work until:**
1. ‚úÖ ALL rules in PRIMARY DIRECTIVES have been READ
2. ‚úÖ ALL rules have been individually ACKNOWLEDGED
3. ‚úÖ Verification marker has been CREATED
4. ‚úÖ You have stated readiness to execute DISTRIBUTE_FIX_PLANS work

### üö® FAILURE TO READ STATE RULES FIRST = IMMEDIATE EXIT üö®
**If you do ANY DISTRIBUTE_FIX_PLANS work before reading and acknowledging rules:**
- **STOP ALL WORK IMMEDIATELY**
- **EXIT WITH FAILURE STATUS**
- **YOU HAVE VIOLATED STATE COMPLIANCE**

**After reading ALL rules, acknowledge them:**
‚ñ° I have read R234 - Mandatory State Traversal (SUPREME LAW #1)
‚ñ° I have read R208 - No Implementation in Orchestrator (SUPREME LAW #2)
‚ñ° I have read R290 - State Rule Reading and Verification (SUPREME LAW #3)
‚ñ° I have read R239 - Fix Plan Distribution Protocol
‚ñ° I have read R209 - Effort Directory Isolation Protocol
‚ñ° I have read R194 - Remote Branch Tracking
‚ñ° I have read R206 - State Machine Transition Validation

**CRITICAL**: You must have made 8 actual Read tool calls. Count them!

## üî¥üî¥üî¥ SUPREME DIRECTIVE: DISTRIBUTE FIX PLANS TO EFFORT DIRECTORIES üî¥üî¥üî¥

**COPY FIX PLANS TO EACH EFFORT'S WORKING DIRECTORY!**

## State Overview

In DISTRIBUTE_FIX_PLANS, you copy the fix plans created by Code Reviewer to each effort's working directory so engineers can access them.

## Required Actions

### 1. Load Fix Plan Summary
```bash
PHASE=$(yq '.current_phase' orchestrator-state.yaml)
WAVE=$(yq '.current_wave' orchestrator-state.yaml)
FIX_PLAN_DIR="efforts/phase${PHASE}/wave${WAVE}/fix-plans"
SUMMARY_FILE="${FIX_PLAN_DIR}/FIX_PLAN_SUMMARY.yaml"
TIMESTAMP=$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S)

echo "üì¶ Distributing fix plans to effort directories"

# Parse fix plans from summary
readarray -t FIX_PLANS < <(yq '.fix_plans_created[].effort' "$SUMMARY_FILE")
readarray -t PLAN_FILES < <(yq '.fix_plans_created[].plan_file' "$SUMMARY_FILE")
```

### 2. Distribute Fix Plans to Efforts
```bash
DISTRIBUTION_LOG="efforts/phase${PHASE}/wave${WAVE}/FIX_DISTRIBUTION_LOG_${TIMESTAMP}.md"
echo "# Fix Plan Distribution Log" > "$DISTRIBUTION_LOG"
echo "Timestamp: $(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)" >> "$DISTRIBUTION_LOG"
echo "" >> "$DISTRIBUTION_LOG"

for i in "${!FIX_PLANS[@]}"; do
    EFFORT="${FIX_PLANS[$i]}"
    PLAN_FILE="${PLAN_FILES[$i]}"
    SOURCE_FILE="${FIX_PLAN_DIR}/${PLAN_FILE}"
    EFFORT_DIR="efforts/phase${PHASE}/wave${WAVE}/${EFFORT}"
    DEST_FILE="${EFFORT_DIR}/INTEGRATION_FIX_PLAN_${TIMESTAMP}.md"
    
    echo "üìã Distributing fix plan for effort: $EFFORT"
    
    # Verify effort directory exists
    if [ ! -d "$EFFORT_DIR" ]; then
        echo "‚ùå ERROR: Effort directory not found: $EFFORT_DIR"
        echo "- ERROR: $EFFORT directory not found" >> "$DISTRIBUTION_LOG"
        continue
    fi
    
    # Copy fix plan to effort directory
    cp "$SOURCE_FILE" "$DEST_FILE"
    
    # Add marker file for engineer to find
    echo "INTEGRATION_FIX_REQUIRED" > "${EFFORT_DIR}/FIX_REQUIRED.flag"
    echo "$DEST_FILE" > "${EFFORT_DIR}/FIX_PLAN_LOCATION.txt"
    
    # Commit to effort branch
    cd "$EFFORT_DIR"
    BRANCH="phase${PHASE}-wave${WAVE}-${EFFORT}"
    git checkout "$BRANCH" 2>/dev/null || git checkout -b "$BRANCH"
    git add "INTEGRATION_FIX_PLAN_${TIMESTAMP}.md" "FIX_REQUIRED.flag" "FIX_PLAN_LOCATION.txt"
    git commit -m "fix-plan: Integration fixes required [${TIMESTAMP}]" \
               -m "Fix plan distributed from Code Reviewer" \
               -m "See INTEGRATION_FIX_PLAN_${TIMESTAMP}.md for instructions"
    git push origin "$BRANCH"
    
    echo "‚úÖ Fix plan distributed to: $DEST_FILE"
    echo "- ‚úÖ $EFFORT: $DEST_FILE" >> "$DISTRIBUTION_LOG"
    
    # Return to orchestrator directory
    cd - > /dev/null
done

echo "" >> "$DISTRIBUTION_LOG"
echo "Total efforts with fix plans: ${#FIX_PLANS[@]}" >> "$DISTRIBUTION_LOG"
```

### 3. Update State File
```bash
# Record distribution
yq eval ".integration_feedback.wave${WAVE}.fix_plans_distributed = \"$(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)\"" -i orchestrator-state.yaml
yq eval ".integration_feedback.wave${WAVE}.distribution_log = \"$DISTRIBUTION_LOG\"" -i orchestrator-state.yaml

# Mark efforts as needing fixes
for effort in "${FIX_PLANS[@]}"; do
    yq eval ".efforts_in_progress.\"$effort\".needs_fixes = true" -i orchestrator-state.yaml
    yq eval ".efforts_in_progress.\"$effort\".fix_plan_distributed = \"$(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)\"" -i orchestrator-state.yaml
done

# Transition to spawn engineers
yq eval ".current_state = \"SPAWN_ENGINEERS_FOR_FIXES\"" -i orchestrator-state.yaml
yq eval ".state_transition_history += [{\"from\": \"DISTRIBUTE_FIX_PLANS\", \"to\": \"SPAWN_ENGINEERS_FOR_FIXES\", \"timestamp\": \"$(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)\", \"reason\": \"Fix plans distributed to ${#FIX_PLANS[@]} efforts\"}]" -i orchestrator-state.yaml

# Commit
git add orchestrator-state.yaml "$DISTRIBUTION_LOG"
git commit -m "distribute: Fix plans sent to ${#FIX_PLANS[@]} efforts"
git push
```

## Valid Transitions

1. **ALWAYS**: `DISTRIBUTE_FIX_PLANS` ‚Üí `SPAWN_ENGINEERS_FOR_FIXES`
   - Transition after distribution complete

## Distribution Requirements

For each effort needing fixes:
1. Copy fix plan to effort directory
2. Create FIX_REQUIRED.flag marker
3. Create FIX_PLAN_LOCATION.txt pointer
4. Commit to effort's branch
5. Push to remote

## Grading Criteria

- ‚úÖ **+25%**: Copy plans to correct directories
- ‚úÖ **+25%**: Create marker files
- ‚úÖ **+25%**: Commit and push to effort branches
- ‚úÖ **+25%**: Update state file properly

## Common Violations

- ‚ùå **-100%**: Not distributing fix plans
- ‚ùå **-50%**: Wrong effort directories
- ‚ùå **-50%**: Not committing to branches
- ‚ùå **-30%**: Missing marker files

## üî¥üî¥üî¥ MANDATORY MEASUREMENT RULE - R304 üî¥üî¥üî¥

### R304: Mandatory Line Counter Tool Enforcement
**File**: `$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/rule-library/R304-mandatory-line-counter-enforcement.md`
**Criticality**: BLOCKING - Manual counting = AUTOMATIC -100% FAILURE

**ABSOLUTE REQUIREMENTS:**
- ‚úÖ MUST use `$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/tools/line-counter.sh` for ALL line counting
- ‚ùå NEVER use `wc -l` or any manual counting method
- ‚ùå NEVER count lines any other way - this is a -100% automatic failure
- ‚úÖ MUST specify both -b (base branch) and -c (current branch) parameters
- ‚úÖ Base branch MUST be phase integration branch (NOT "main")

**Failure to use the line counter tool = AUTOMATIC -100% GRADE**

## R322 VIOLATION DETECTION

If you find yourself:
- Starting work for a new state without /continue-orchestrating
- Transitioning without stopping after state file commit
- Continuing after completing state work

**STOP IMMEDIATELY - You are violating R322!**
