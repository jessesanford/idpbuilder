# Orchestrator - ERROR_RECOVERY State Rules

## üõëüõëüõë R322 MANDATORY STOP BEFORE STATE TRANSITIONS üõëüõëüõë

**SUPREME LAW - VIOLATION = -100% IMMEDIATE FAILURE**

### YOU MUST STOP AFTER:
1. ‚úÖ Completing all TODOs for this state
2. ‚úÖ Updating orchestrator-state.json with new state
3. ‚úÖ Committing and pushing the state file  
4. ‚úÖ Providing work summary

### YOU MUST NOT:
- ‚ùå Continue to the next state automatically
- ‚ùå Start work for the new state
- ‚ùå Spawn agents for the new state
- ‚ùå Assume permission to continue

### STOP PROTOCOL:
```markdown
## üõë STATE TRANSITION CHECKPOINT: CURRENT_STATE ‚Üí NEXT_STATE

### ‚úÖ Current State Work Completed:
- [List completed work]

### üìä Current Status:
- Current State: CURRENT_STATE
- Next State: NEXT_STATE
- TODOs Completed: X/Y
- State Files: Updated and committed ‚úÖ

### ‚è∏Ô∏è STOPPED - Awaiting User Continuation
Ready to transition to NEXT_STATE. Please use /continue-orchestrating.
```

**STOP MEANS STOP - Exit and wait for /continue-orchestrating**

---


## üî¥üî¥üî¥ STOP! STATE RULE READING IS ABSOLUTELY FIRST! üî¥üî¥üî¥

**YOU HAVE ENTERED ERROR_RECOVERY STATE - YOU MUST READ AND ACKNOWLEDGE ALL STATE RULES BEFORE DOING ANY STATE WORK!**

## üî¥üî¥üî¥ R290 VERIFICATION REQUIREMENT üî¥üî¥üî¥

**R290 ENFORCEMENT: CREATE VERIFICATION MARKER AFTER READING**

After reading and acknowledging all state rules, you MUST create a verification marker:

```bash
# MANDATORY: Create verification marker after reading rules
touch .state_rules_read_orchestrator_ERROR_RECOVERY
echo "$(date +%s) - Rules read and acknowledged for ERROR_RECOVERY" > .state_rules_read_orchestrator_ERROR_RECOVERY
```

**FAILURE TO CREATE MARKER = AUTOMATIC -100% PENALTY**

The system will check for this marker. No marker = Immediate failure.

### ‚ùå DO NOT DO ANY ERROR_RECOVERY WORK UNTIL RULES ARE READ:
- ‚ùå Start diagnose errors
- ‚ùå Start recover from failures
- ‚ùå Start restart failed efforts
- ‚ùå Update state files
- ‚ùå Continue to next state
- ‚ùå Think about what to do in this state

### ‚úÖ YOU MUST IMMEDIATELY:

## üî¥üî¥üî¥ MANDATORY STATE RULE READING AND ACKNOWLEDGMENT üî¥üî¥üî¥

### ‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è YOU MUST READ EACH RULE FILE LISTED IN PRIMARY DIRECTIVES. **I AM WATCHING YOUR TOOL CALLS FOR READ OPERATIONS** *YOU WILL FAIL* IF YOU DO NOT MAKE A READ FILE CALL FOR EACH RULE FILE IN PRIMARY DIRECTIVES!!! ‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è

**AFTER READING, YOU MUST ACKNOWLEDGE ALL THE STATE RULES AND STATE THAT YOU WILL ABIDE BY THEM ONE AT A TIME GIVING THE RULE NUMBER AND DESCRIPTION.**

### ‚ùå ANTI-PATTERNS THAT WILL CAUSE FAILURE:

1. **Fake Acknowledgment Without Reading**:
   ```
   ‚ùå WRONG: "I acknowledge R151, R208, R053..."
   (No Read tool calls detected = AUTOMATIC FAILURE)
   ```

2. **Bulk Acknowledgment**:
   ```
   ‚ùå WRONG: "I acknowledge all ERROR_RECOVERY rules"
   (YOU Must READ AND ACKNOWLEDGE EACH rule individually)
   ```

3. **Silent Reading**:
   ```
   ‚ùå WRONG: [Reads rules but doesn't acknowledge]
   "Now I've read the rules, let me start work..."
   (MUST explicitly acknowledge EACH rule)
   ```

4. **Reading From Memory**:
   ```
   ‚ùå WRONG: "I know R208 requires CD before spawn..."
   (Must READ from file, not recall from memory)
   ```

5. **Skipping Rules in PRIMARY DIRECTIVES**:
   ```
   ‚ùå WRONG: Reading only some rules from the list
   (ALL rules in PRIMARY DIRECTIVES are MANDATORY)
   ```

### ‚úÖ CORRECT PATTERN FOR ERROR_RECOVERY:
```
1. READ: $CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/rule-library/[first-rule-file].md
2. "I acknowledge [Rule#] - [Rule Name]: [Brief description]"
3. READ: $CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/rule-library/[second-rule-file].md  
4. "I acknowledge [Rule#] - [Rule Name]: [Brief description]"
[Continue for EVERY rule in PRIMARY DIRECTIVES...]
5. "Ready to execute ERROR_RECOVERY work"
```

### üö® NO WORK UNTIL ACKNOWLEDGMENT COMPLETE üö®
**You may NOT begin ANY ERROR_RECOVERY work until:**
1. ‚úÖ ALL rules in PRIMARY DIRECTIVES have been READ
2. ‚úÖ ALL rules have been individually ACKNOWLEDGED
3. ‚úÖ You have stated readiness to execute ERROR_RECOVERY work
1. **READ** every rule file listed in PRIMARY DIRECTIVES below
2. **ACKNOWLEDGE** each rule individually with number and description
3. **ONLY THEN** proceed with ERROR_RECOVERY work

### üö® FAILURE TO READ STATE RULES FIRST = IMMEDIATE EXIT üö®
**If you do ANY ERROR_RECOVERY work before reading and acknowledging rules:**
- **STOP ALL WORK IMMEDIATELY**
- **EXIT WITH FAILURE STATUS**
- **YOU HAVE VIOLATED STATE COMPLIANCE**

**THE SYSTEM IS MONITORING YOUR READ TOOL CALLS!**

## ‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è MANDATORY RULE READING AND ACKNOWLEDGMENT ‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è

**YOU MUST READ EACH RULE FILE LISTED IN PRIMARY DIRECTIVES. YOUR READ TOOL CALLS ARE BEING MONITORED.**

### ‚ùå ANTI-PATTERNS THAT WILL CAUSE FAILURE:
1. Fake acknowledgment without reading
2. Bulk acknowledgment
3. Reading from memory

### ‚úÖ CORRECT PATTERN:
1. READ each rule file
2. Acknowledge individually with rule number and description

## üî¥üî¥üî¥ COMMON ERROR_RECOVERY TRIGGERS (R291 ENFORCEMENT) üî¥üî¥üî¥

**YOU ARE IN ERROR_RECOVERY BECAUSE ONE OF THESE LIKELY OCCURRED:**

1. **BUILD GATE FAILURE** (R291 Violation)
   - Build compilation failed (make/npm build/cargo build returned non-zero)
   - No build artifacts produced (missing dist/build/target)
   - Build process crashed or timed out

2. **TEST GATE FAILURE** (R291 Violation)
   - Unit tests failed
   - Integration tests failed
   - E2E tests failed
   - ANY test suite returned non-zero exit code

3. **DEMO GATE FAILURE** (R291 Violation)
   - Demo script failed (exit code != 0)
   - Features don't work as expected
   - Demo cannot be run due to missing components

4. **INTEGRATION FAILURES**
   - Merge conflicts that couldn't be resolved
   - Dependency issues blocking build
   - Incompatible changes between efforts

5. **ASSESSMENT FAILURES**
   - Architect phase assessment failed
   - Wave review identified critical issues
   - Quality gates not met

**YOUR FIRST ACTION:** Check orchestrator-state.json for `error_recovery.reason` to understand why you're here!

## üö® ERROR_RECOVERY IS A VERB - START ERROR RECOVERY IMMEDIATELY! üö®

### IMMEDIATE ACTIONS UPON ENTERING ERROR_RECOVERY

**THE MOMENT YOU ENTER THIS STATE, YOU MUST:**
1. Diagnose the error from state file NOW
2. Create recovery plan immediately
3. Check TodoWrite for pending items and process them
4. Begin executing recovery steps

**FORBIDDEN - AUTOMATIC FAILURE:**
- ‚ùå "STATE TRANSITION COMPLETE: Now in ERROR_RECOVERY" [stops]
- ‚ùå "Successfully entered ERROR_RECOVERY state" [waits]
- ‚ùå "Ready to start error recovery" [pauses]
- ‚ùå "I'm in ERROR_RECOVERY state" [does nothing]

**REQUIRED - IMMEDIATE ACTION:**
- ‚úÖ "Entering ERROR_RECOVERY, Diagnose the error from state file NOW..."
- ‚úÖ "START ERROR RECOVERY, create recovery plan immediately..."
- ‚úÖ "ERROR_RECOVERY: Begin executing recovery steps..."

## üî¥üî¥üî¥ MANDATORY MEASUREMENT RULE - R304 üî¥üî¥üî¥

**ABSOLUTE REQUIREMENTS:**
- ‚úÖ MUST use `$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/tools/line-counter.sh` for ALL line counting
- ‚ùå NEVER use `wc -l` or any manual counting method
- ‚ùå NEVER count lines any other way - this is a -100% automatic failure
- ‚úÖ MUST specify both -b (base branch) and -c (current branch) parameters
- ‚úÖ Base branch MUST be phase integration branch (NOT "main")

**Failure to use the line counter tool = AUTOMATIC -100% GRADE**

## State Context
You are recovering from critical errors that have blocked normal operation flow.


### üî¥üî¥üî¥ RULE R322 - Mandatory Stop Before State Transitions (SUPREME LAW)
**SEE**: `$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/rule-library/R322-mandatory-stop-before-state-transitions.md`
**CRITICAL FOR ERROR_RECOVERY**: Never stop recovering until resolved or explicit stop
