# üî¥üî¥üî¥ SUPREME LAW R217 - ABSOLUTE RULE RELOADING üî¥üî¥üî¥

## ‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è THIS IS THE HIGHEST PRIORITY RULE - SUPERSEDES ALL OTHERS ‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è

# NOTHING - ABSOLUTELY NOTHING - CAN BE DONE AFTER A STATE TRANSITION UNTIL RULES ARE RELOADED

## THE LAW IS ABSOLUTE:

```
AFTER STATE TRANSITION:
1. UPDATE STATE ‚úì
2. IMMEDIATELY READ AND ACKNOWLEDGE RULES ‚Üê YOU MUST DO THIS NOW
3. ONLY THEN MAY YOU CONTINUE

NO EXCEPTIONS. NO DEFERRALS. NO "BUT FIRST".
```

## üö´ FORBIDDEN PHRASES AFTER STATE TRANSITION:
- ‚ùå "But first, let me..."
- ‚ùå "Before reading rules, I'll..."
- ‚ùå "I'll acknowledge rules after..."
- ‚ùå "Let me complete... then acknowledge"
- ‚ùå "According to R217, I must... But first..."

## ‚úÖ ONLY ACCEPTABLE RESPONSE AFTER STATE TRANSITION:

```bash
echo "üî¥üî¥üî¥ R217 SUPREME LAW: MANDATORY IMMEDIATE RULE RELOADING üî¥üî¥üî¥"
echo "State transition detected. STOPPING ALL WORK."
echo "Reading rules NOW before ANY other action..."

# READ: .claude/agents/orchestrator.md
# READ: SOFTWARE-FACTORY-STATE-MACHINE.md
# READ: agent-states/orchestrator/$NEW_STATE/rules.md

echo "‚úÖ Rules reloaded and acknowledged for state: $NEW_STATE"
echo "NOW I may continue with work."
```

## ENFORCEMENT:

**VIOLATION DETECTION:**
If you EVER see yourself writing:
- "But first"
- "Let me complete"
- "Before acknowledging"

**IMMEDIATE CORRECTION REQUIRED:**
1. STOP
2. DELETE that message
3. READ RULES IMMEDIATELY
4. Start over with rules acknowledged

## THIS IS NON-NEGOTIABLE

The INSTANT you transition states:
1. The VERY NEXT line must be about reading rules
2. You may NOT create TODOs before reading rules
3. You may NOT plan work before reading rules
4. You may NOT execute commands before reading rules
5. You may NOT do ANYTHING except read rules

## GRADING CONSEQUENCE:

**AUTOMATIC FAILURE** if you defer rule reading even once.

This is equivalent to a compiler refusing to check syntax - it's a fundamental violation of the system's integrity.

## THE SEQUENCE IS SACRED:

```python
def after_state_transition(old_state, new_state):
    update_state_file(new_state)  # ‚úì Allowed
    
    # THE VERY NEXT THING MUST BE:
    read_and_acknowledge_rules()  # ‚Üê NO OTHER CODE BEFORE THIS
    
    # ONLY AFTER RULES ARE READ:
    continue_with_work()  # ‚Üê Now you may proceed
```

## REMEMBER:

**R217 IS SUPREME LAW**
**R217 CANNOT BE DEFERRED**
**R217 MUST EXECUTE IMMEDIATELY**
**R217 IS THE FIRST ACTION AFTER STATE CHANGE**

# üî¥ IF YOU VIOLATE THIS, YOU HAVE FAILED üî¥
