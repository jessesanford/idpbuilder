# Orchestrator - MONITORING_BACKPORT_PROGRESS State Rules

## üõëüõëüõë R322 MANDATORY STOP BEFORE STATE TRANSITIONS üõëüõëüõë

**SUPREME LAW - VIOLATION = -100% IMMEDIATE FAILURE**

### YOU MUST STOP AFTER:
1. ‚úÖ Completing all TODOs for this state
2. ‚úÖ Updating orchestrator-state.yaml with new state
3. ‚úÖ Committing and pushing the state file  
4. ‚úÖ Providing work summary

- ‚ùå Assume permission to continue

### STOP PROTOCOL:
```markdown
## üõë STATE TRANSITION CHECKPOINT: CURRENT_STATE ‚Üí NEXT_STATE

### ‚úÖ Current State Work Completed:
- [List completed work]

### üìä Current Status:
- Current State: CURRENT_STATE
- Next State: NEXT_STATE
- TODOs Completed: X/Y
- State Files: Updated and committed ‚úÖ

### ‚è∏Ô∏è STOPPED - Awaiting User Continuation
Ready to transition to NEXT_STATE. Please use /continue-orchestrating.
```

**STOP MEANS STOP - Exit and wait for /continue-orchestrating**

## üî¥üî¥üî¥ STOP! STATE RULE READING IS ABSOLUTELY FIRST! üî¥üî¥üî¥

**YOU HAVE ENTERED MONITORING_BACKPORT_PROGRESS STATE - YOU MUST READ AND ACKNOWLEDGE ALL STATE RULES BEFORE DOING ANY STATE WORK!**

## üî¥üî¥üî¥ R290 VERIFICATION REQUIREMENT üî¥üî¥üî¥

**R290 ENFORCEMENT: CREATE VERIFICATION MARKER AFTER READING**

After reading and acknowledging all state rules, you MUST create a verification marker:

```bash
# MANDATORY: Create verification marker after reading rules
touch .state_rules_read_orchestrator_MONITORING_BACKPORT_PROGRESS
echo "$(date +%s) - Rules read and acknowledged for MONITORING_BACKPORT_PROGRESS" > .state_rules_read_orchestrator_MONITORING_BACKPORT_PROGRESS
```

**FAILURE TO CREATE MARKER = AUTOMATIC -100% PENALTY**

## üìã PRIMARY DIRECTIVES FOR MONITORING_BACKPORT_PROGRESS STATE

### Core Mandatory Rules (ALL orchestrator states must have these):

1. **üö®üö®üö® R006** - ORCHESTRATOR NEVER WRITES CODE OR PERFORMS FILE OPERATIONS (BLOCKING)
   - File: `$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/rule-library/R006-orchestrator-never-writes-code.md`
   - Criticality: BLOCKING - Automatic termination, 0% grade
   - Summary: NEVER write, copy, move, or manipulate ANY code files - delegate ALL to agents
   - **CRITICAL**: Copying files is NOT infrastructure - it's implementation work!

2. **üî¥üî¥üî¥ R287** - TODO PERSISTENCE COMPREHENSIVE (SUPREME LAW)
   - File: `$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/rule-library/R287-todo-persistence-comprehensive.md`
   - Criticality: SUPREME - -20% to -100% penalty for violations
   - Summary: MUST save TODOs within 30s after write, every 10 messages, before transitions
   - **CRITICAL**: Commit and push within 60 seconds of saving

3. **üî¥üî¥üî¥ R288** - STATE FILE UPDATE REQUIREMENTS (SUPREME LAW)
   - File: `$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/rule-library/R288-state-file-update-requirements.md`
   - Criticality: SUPREME - State updates required for all transitions
   - Summary: MUST update orchestrator-state.yaml before EVERY state transition
   - **CRITICAL**: Commit and push state changes immediately

4. **üö®üö®üö® R304** - MANDATORY LINE COUNTER TOOL ENFORCEMENT (BLOCKING)
   - File: `$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/rule-library/R304-mandatory-line-counter-enforcement.md`
   - Criticality: BLOCKING - Manual counting = AUTOMATIC -100% FAILURE
   - Summary: MUST use tools/line-counter.sh for ALL line counting
   - **CRITICAL**: NEVER use wc -l or manual counting

### State-Specific Rules:

5. **‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è R237** - Waiting State Monitoring Requirements
   - File: `$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/rule-library/R237-waiting-state-monitoring.md`
   - Criticality: WARNING - Must actively monitor
   - Summary: Must check progress regularly, not passively wait

6. **üî¥üî¥üî¥ R321** - Immediate Backport During Integration Protocol
   - File: `$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/rule-library/R321-immediate-backport-during-integration.md`
   - Criticality: SUPREME LAW - Immediate backporting required
   - Summary: ALL fixes must go to source branches IMMEDIATELY

## üéØ STATE OBJECTIVES - MONITORING SW ENGINEER BACKPORT PROGRESS

In the MONITORING_BACKPORT_PROGRESS state, the ORCHESTRATOR is responsible for:

1. **Active Progress Monitoring**
   - Check each SW Engineer's state file regularly
   - Track completion status for each effort
   - Identify any BLOCKED engineers
   - Monitor for timeout conditions

2. **Progress Aggregation**
   - Count completed backports
   - Track remaining work
   - Calculate completion percentage
   - Estimate time to completion

3. **Issue Detection and Response**
   - Detect blocked engineers
   - Identify failed backports
   - Document issues for resolution
   - Determine if ERROR_RECOVERY needed

4. **Completion Verification**
   - Verify all backports complete
   - Check all branches updated
   - Confirm builds pass
   - Prepare for next state transition

## üìù REQUIRED ACTIONS

### Step 1: Initial Status Assessment
```bash
# Get initial status of all SW Engineers
cd /efforts

### Step 4: Create Completion Report
```bash
# Create comprehensive completion report
cd /efforts/integration-testing

cat > BACKPORT-COMPLETION-REPORT.md << 'EOF'
# Backport Progress Monitoring - Final Report

## Monitoring Summary
- Start Time: [timestamp]
- End Time: [timestamp]
- Total Duration: ${ELAPSED_TIME} seconds
- Monitor Checks: $((ELAPSED_TIME / MONITOR_INTERVAL))

## Backport Status
### Completed Successfully: ${COMPLETED_COUNT}
$(for EFFORT in completed_efforts; do
    echo "- ${EFFORT}: ‚úÖ Complete"
done)

### In Progress: ${IN_PROGRESS_COUNT}
$(for EFFORT in progress_efforts; do
    echo "- ${EFFORT}: ‚è≥ Still working"
done)

### Blocked: ${BLOCKED_COUNT}
$(for EFFORT in blocked_efforts; do
    echo "- ${EFFORT}: ‚ùå Blocked"
done)

## Verification Results
- All builds passing: YES/NO
- All tests passing: YES/NO
- All branches pushed: YES/NO
- Ready for PR creation: YES/NO

## Issues Encountered
[List any issues, blocks, or failures]

## Next State Recommendation
$(if [ "$ALL_COMPLETE" = true ] && [ "$VERIFICATION_PASSED" = true ]; then
    echo "‚úÖ Proceed to PR_PLAN_CREATION"
else
    echo "‚ö†Ô∏è ERROR_RECOVERY may be needed"
fi)

## Branch Update Summary
[List commits added to each branch]
EOF

echo "‚úÖ Completion report created"
```

### Step 5: Prepare State Transition
```bash
# Update state based on results
cd $CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR

if [ "$ALL_COMPLETE" = true ] && [ "$VERIFICATION_PASSED" = true ]; then
    # Success - all backports complete
    cat > orchestrator-state.yaml << 'EOF'
current_state: PR_PLAN_CREATION
previous_state: MONITORING_BACKPORT_PROGRESS
backport_status: COMPLETE
backports_completed: ${COMPLETED_COUNT}/${TOTAL_COUNT}
verification: PASSED
all_branches_updated: true
ready_for_pr: true
monitoring_duration: ${ELAPSED_TIME}
next_action: Create PR plan for updated branches
EOF
    
    git add orchestrator-state.yaml
    git commit -m "state: all backports complete - transition to PR_PLAN_CREATION"
    
elif [ $BLOCKED_COUNT -gt 0 ]; then
    # Blocked - need error recovery
    cat > orchestrator-state.yaml << 'EOF'
current_state: ERROR_RECOVERY
previous_state: MONITORING_BACKPORT_PROGRESS
backport_status: BLOCKED
backports_completed: ${COMPLETED_COUNT}/${TOTAL_COUNT}
backports_blocked: ${BLOCKED_COUNT}/${TOTAL_COUNT}
issues: "SW Engineers blocked during backport implementation"
requires_intervention: true
EOF
    
    git add orchestrator-state.yaml
    git commit -m "state: backports blocked - transition to ERROR_RECOVERY"
    
else
    # Timeout or other issue
    cat > orchestrator-state.yaml << 'EOF'
current_state: ERROR_RECOVERY
previous_state: MONITORING_BACKPORT_PROGRESS
backport_status: TIMEOUT
backports_completed: ${COMPLETED_COUNT}/${TOTAL_COUNT}
backports_in_progress: ${IN_PROGRESS_COUNT}/${TOTAL_COUNT}
timeout_after: ${MAX_MONITOR_TIME}
EOF
    
    git add orchestrator-state.yaml
    git commit -m "state: backport timeout - transition to ERROR_RECOVERY"
fi

git push
echo "‚úÖ State updated and pushed"
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS

### Active Monitoring (R237)
- Check progress every 30-60 seconds
- Cannot passively wait
- Document each monitoring cycle

### No Direct Intervention
- If engineer is blocked, document it
- Do NOT try to fix issues yourself
- Transition to ERROR_RECOVERY if needed

### Complete Verification
- All engineers must complete
- All branches must be updated
- Verification must pass for success

## üö´ FORBIDDEN ACTIONS

1. **Fixing blocked backports yourself** - R006 violation
2. **Passive waiting without checks** - R237 violation
3. **Continuing with incomplete backports** - Will cause PR failures
4. **Modifying SW Engineer work** - They own their branches
5. **Skipping verification** - Must ensure quality

## ‚úÖ SUCCESS CRITERIA

For successful transition to PR_PLAN_CREATION:
- [ ] All SW Engineers report BACKPORT_COMPLETE
- [ ] No engineers in BLOCKED state
- [ ] All branches have new commits
- [ ] Verification checks pass
- [ ] Completion report created
- [ ] State updated appropriately

## üîÑ STATE TRANSITIONS

### Success Path:
```
MONITORING_BACKPORT_PROGRESS ‚Üí PR_PLAN_CREATION
```
- All backports complete
- Verification passed
- Ready for PRs

### Error Paths:
```
MONITORING_BACKPORT_PROGRESS ‚Üí ERROR_RECOVERY
```
- Engineers blocked
- Timeout occurred
- Verification failed

## üéì GRADING CRITERIA

You will be evaluated on:
1. **Active Monitoring** (35%)
   - Regular progress checks
   - R237 compliance
   
2. **Issue Detection** (25%)
   - Identifying blocks quickly
   - Catching failures
   
3. **Verification Quality** (25%)
   - Thorough verification
   - Quality assurance
   
4. **Documentation** (15%)
   - Clear progress tracking
   - Complete final report

## üí° TIPS FOR SUCCESS

1. **Check frequently** - Every 30 seconds is good
2. **Document everything** - Show active monitoring
3. **Detect issues early** - Don't wait for timeout
4. **Verify thoroughly** - Ensure quality backports

Remember: You're the PROJECT MANAGER - monitor, verify, report!

## R322 VIOLATION DETECTION

If you find yourself:
- Starting work for a new state without /continue-orchestrating
- Transitioning without stopping after state file commit
- Continuing after completing state work

**STOP IMMEDIATELY - You are violating R322!**
