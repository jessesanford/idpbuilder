## üî¥üî¥üî¥ R290 ENFORCEMENT: READ THESE RULES FIRST! üî¥üî¥üî¥

**SUPREME LAW #3 (R290): STATE RULES MUST BE READ BEFORE STATE ACTIONS**

## üî¥üî¥üî¥ STOP! STATE RULE READING IS ABSOLUTELY FIRST! üî¥üî¥üî¥

**YOU HAVE ENTERED WAITING_FOR_FIX_PLANS STATE - YOU MUST READ AND ACKNOWLEDGE ALL STATE RULES BEFORE DOING ANY STATE WORK!**

## üî¥üî¥üî¥ R290 VERIFICATION REQUIREMENT üî¥üî¥üî¥

**R290 ENFORCEMENT: CREATE VERIFICATION MARKER AFTER READING**

After reading and acknowledging all state rules, you MUST create a verification marker:

```bash
# MANDATORY: Create verification marker after reading rules
touch .state_rules_read_orchestrator_WAITING_FOR_FIX_PLANS
echo "$(date +%s) - Rules read and acknowledged for WAITING_FOR_FIX_PLANS" > .state_rules_read_orchestrator_WAITING_FOR_FIX_PLANS
```

**FAILURE TO CREATE MARKER = AUTOMATIC -100% PENALTY**

The system will check for this marker. No marker = Immediate failure.

### ‚ùå DO NOT DO ANY WAITING WORK UNTIL RULES ARE READ:
- ‚ùå Check for fix plan summaries
- ‚ùå Verify fix plan files
- ‚ùå Monitor Code Reviewer progress
- ‚ùå Update state files
- ‚ùå Continue to next state
- ‚ùå Think about what to do in this state

### ‚úÖ YOU MUST IMMEDIATELY:

## üî¥üî¥üî¥ MANDATORY STATE RULE READING AND ACKNOWLEDGMENT üî¥üî¥üî¥

### ‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è YOU MUST READ EACH RULE FILE LISTED IN PRIMARY DIRECTIVES. **I AM WATCHING YOUR TOOL CALLS FOR READ OPERATIONS** *YOU WILL FAIL* IF YOU DO NOT MAKE A READ FILE CALL FOR EACH RULE FILE IN PRIMARY DIRECTIVES!!! ‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è

**AFTER READING, YOU MUST ACKNOWLEDGE ALL THE STATE RULES AND STATE THAT YOU WILL ABIDE BY THEM ONE AT A TIME GIVING THE RULE NUMBER AND DESCRIPTION.**

### PRIMARY DIRECTIVES - MANDATORY READING:

### üõë RULE R322 - Mandatory Stop Before State Transitions
**Source:** $CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/rule-library/R322-mandatory-stop-before-state-transitions.md
**Criticality:** üî¥üî¥üî¥ SUPREME LAW - Violation = -100% FAILURE

After completing state work and committing state file:
1. STOP IMMEDIATELY
2. Do NOT continue to next state
3. Do NOT start new work
4. Exit and wait for user

**USE THESE EXACT READ COMMANDS (IN THIS ORDER):**
1. Read: $CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/rule-library/R234-mandatory-state-traversal-supreme-law.md
2. Read: $CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/rule-library/R006-orchestrator-never-writes-code.md
3. Read: $CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/rule-library/R290-state-rule-reading-verification-supreme-law.md
5. Read: $CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/rule-library/R239-fix-plan-distribution.md
6. Read: $CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/rule-library/R008-monitoring-frequency.md
7. Read: $CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/rule-library/R206-state-machine-transition-validation.md

**WE ARE WATCHING EACH READ TOOL CALL**

### ‚ùå ANTI-PATTERNS THAT WILL CAUSE FAILURE:

1. **Fake Acknowledgment Without Reading**:
   ```
   ‚ùå WRONG: "I acknowledge R234, R208, R290..."
   (No Read tool calls detected = AUTOMATIC FAILURE)
   ```

2. **Bulk Acknowledgment**:
   ```
   ‚ùå WRONG: "I acknowledge all WAITING_FOR_FIX_PLANS rules"
   (YOU Must READ AND ACKNOWLEDGE EACH rule individually)
   ```

3. **Silent Reading**:
   ```
   ‚ùå WRONG: [Reads rules but doesn't acknowledge]
   "Now I've read the rules, let me start work..."
   (MUST explicitly acknowledge EACH rule)
   ```

4. **Reading From Memory**:
   ```
   ‚ùå WRONG: "I know R239 requires fix plan distribution..."
   (Must READ from file, not recall from memory)
   ```

5. **Skipping Rules in PRIMARY DIRECTIVES**:
   ```
   ‚ùå WRONG: Reading only some rules from the list
   (ALL rules in PRIMARY DIRECTIVES are MANDATORY)
   ```

### ‚úÖ CORRECT PATTERN FOR WAITING_FOR_FIX_PLANS:
```
1. READ: $CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/rule-library/R234-mandatory-state-traversal-supreme-law.md
2. "I acknowledge R234 - Mandatory State Traversal: [Brief description]"
3. READ: $CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/rule-library/R006-orchestrator-never-writes-code.md  
4. "I acknowledge R006 - Orchestrator Never Writes Code: [Brief description]"
[Continue for EVERY rule in PRIMARY DIRECTIVES...]
5. Create verification marker
6. "Ready to execute WAITING_FOR_FIX_PLANS work"
```

### üö® NO WORK UNTIL ACKNOWLEDGMENT COMPLETE üö®
**You may NOT begin ANY waiting work until:**
1. ‚úÖ ALL rules in PRIMARY DIRECTIVES have been READ
2. ‚úÖ ALL rules have been individually ACKNOWLEDGED
3. ‚úÖ Verification marker has been created
4. ‚úÖ You have stated readiness to execute WAITING_FOR_FIX_PLANS work

### üö® FAILURE TO READ STATE RULES FIRST = IMMEDIATE EXIT üö®
**If you do ANY waiting work before reading and acknowledging rules:**
- **STOP ALL WORK IMMEDIATELY**
- **EXIT WITH FAILURE STATUS**
- **YOU HAVE VIOLATED STATE COMPLIANCE**

## üî¥üî¥üî¥ SUPREME DIRECTIVE: MONITOR FIX PLAN CREATION üî¥üî¥üî¥

**WAIT FOR CODE REVIEWER TO COMPLETE FIX PLANS!**

## State Overview

In WAITING_FOR_FIX_PLANS, you monitor the Code Reviewer's progress in creating fix plans for integration failures.

## Required Actions

### 1. Check for Fix Plan Summary
```bash
PHASE=$(jq '.current_phase' orchestrator-state.json)
WAVE=$(jq '.current_wave' orchestrator-state.json)
FIX_PLAN_DIR="efforts/phase${PHASE}/wave${WAVE}/fix-plans"
SUMMARY_FILE="${FIX_PLAN_DIR}/FIX_PLAN_SUMMARY.yaml"

echo "‚è≥ Checking for fix plan summary at: $SUMMARY_FILE"

if [ -f "$SUMMARY_FILE" ]; then
    echo "‚úÖ Fix plan summary found!"
    
    # Parse the summary
    TOTAL_EFFORTS=$(jq '.total_efforts' "$SUMMARY_FILE")
    echo "Total efforts with fix plans: $TOTAL_EFFORTS"
    
    # Verify all fix plan files exist
    ALL_PLANS_EXIST=true
    while IFS= read -r plan_file; do
        FULL_PATH="${FIX_PLAN_DIR}/${plan_file}"
        if [ ! -f "$FULL_PATH" ]; then
            echo "‚ùå Missing fix plan file: $FULL_PATH"
            ALL_PLANS_EXIST=false
        else
            echo "‚úÖ Found fix plan: $plan_file"
        fi
    done < <(jq '.fix_plans_created[].plan_file' "$SUMMARY_FILE")
    
    if [ "$ALL_PLANS_EXIST" = true ]; then
        echo "‚úÖ All fix plans created successfully"
        UPDATE_STATE="DISTRIBUTE_FIX_PLANS"
    else
        echo "‚ö†Ô∏è Some fix plans are missing - waiting..."
        sleep 10
        # Stay in WAITING_FOR_FIX_PLANS
    fi
else
    echo "‚è≥ Fix plan summary not yet created - waiting..."
    
    # Check if Code Reviewer is still working
    if pgrep -f "code-reviewer.*fix" > /dev/null; then
        echo "Code Reviewer still working on fix plans..."
        sleep 10
        # Stay in WAITING_FOR_FIX_PLANS
    else
        # Check timeout
        SPAWN_TIME=$(jq '.integration_feedback.wave'${WAVE}'.fix_plan_requested' orchestrator-state.json)
        CURRENT_TIME=$(date +%s)
        SPAWN_TIMESTAMP=$(date -d "$SPAWN_TIME" +%s 2>/dev/null || echo 0)
        ELAPSED=$((CURRENT_TIME - SPAWN_TIMESTAMP))
        
        if [ $ELAPSED -gt 600 ]; then  # 10 minute timeout
            echo "‚ùå Timeout waiting for fix plans (>10 minutes)"
            UPDATE_STATE="ERROR_RECOVERY"
        else
            echo "Waiting for Code Reviewer to complete fix plans..."
            sleep 10
            # Stay in WAITING_FOR_FIX_PLANS
        fi
    fi
fi
```

### 2. Update State When Ready
```bash
if [ -n "$UPDATE_STATE" ]; then
    # Record fix plans in state
    if [ "$UPDATE_STATE" = "DISTRIBUTE_FIX_PLANS" ]; then
        jq ".integration_feedback.wave${WAVE}.fix_plans_completed = \"$(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)\"" -i orchestrator-state.json
        jq '.integration_feedback.wave${WAVE}.total_fix_plans = $TOTAL_EFFORTS' orchestrator-state.json > tmp.json && mv tmp.json orchestrator-state.json
    fi
    
    # Update state
    jq ".current_state = \"$UPDATE_STATE\"" -i orchestrator-state.json
    jq ".state_transition_history += [{\"from\": \"WAITING_FOR_FIX_PLANS\", \"to\": \"$UPDATE_STATE\", \"timestamp\": \"$(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)\", \"reason\": \"Fix plans ready for distribution\"}]" -i orchestrator-state.json
    
    # Commit
    git add orchestrator-state.json
    git commit -m "state: Fix plans complete - transitioning to $UPDATE_STATE"
    git push
fi
```

## Valid Transitions

1. **SUCCESS Path**: `WAITING_FOR_FIX_PLANS` ‚Üí `DISTRIBUTE_FIX_PLANS`
   - When: All fix plans created successfully
   
2. **TIMEOUT Path**: `WAITING_FOR_FIX_PLANS` ‚Üí `ERROR_RECOVERY`
   - When: Fix plan creation exceeds timeout (10 minutes)
   
3. **CONTINUE Path**: `WAITING_FOR_FIX_PLANS` ‚Üí `WAITING_FOR_FIX_PLANS`
   - When: Still waiting for fix plans to complete

## Monitoring Requirements

1. Check for FIX_PLAN_SUMMARY.yaml file
2. Verify all referenced fix plan files exist
3. Monitor Code Reviewer process status
4. Track timeout conditions
5. Transition when all plans ready

## Grading Criteria

- ‚úÖ **+25%**: Check for fix plan summary correctly
- ‚úÖ **+25%**: Verify all fix plan files
- ‚úÖ **+25%**: Handle timeouts properly
- ‚úÖ **+25%**: Update state appropriately

## Common Violations

- ‚ùå **-100%**: Not checking for summary file
- ‚ùå **-50%**: Missing file verification
- ‚ùå **-50%**: No timeout handling
- ‚ùå **-30%**: Wrong state transitions

- R008: Monitoring Frequency
- R206: State Machine Transition Validation

## üî¥üî¥üî¥ MANDATORY MEASUREMENT RULE - R304 üî¥üî¥üî¥

**ABSOLUTE REQUIREMENTS:**
- ‚úÖ MUST use `$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/tools/line-counter.sh` for ALL line counting
- ‚ùå NEVER use `wc -l` or any manual counting method
- ‚ùå NEVER count lines any other way - this is a -100% automatic failure
- ‚úÖ MUST specify both -b (base branch) and -c (current branch) parameters
- ‚úÖ Base branch MUST be phase integration branch (NOT "main")

**Failure to use the line counter tool = AUTOMATIC -100% GRADE**

## R322 VIOLATION DETECTION

If you find yourself:
- Starting work for a new state without /continue-orchestrating
- Transitioning without stopping after state file commit
- Continuing after completing state work

**STOP IMMEDIATELY - You are violating R322!**
