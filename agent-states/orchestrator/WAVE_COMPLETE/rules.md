# Orchestrator - WAVE_COMPLETE State Rules

## üõëüõëüõë R322 MANDATORY STOP BEFORE STATE TRANSITIONS üõëüõëüõë

**SUPREME LAW - VIOLATION = -100% IMMEDIATE FAILURE**

### YOU MUST STOP AFTER:
1. ‚úÖ Completing all TODOs for this state
2. ‚úÖ Updating orchestrator-state.yaml with new state
3. ‚úÖ Committing and pushing the state file  
4. ‚úÖ Providing work summary

### YOU MUST NOT:
- ‚ùå Continue to the next state automatically
- ‚ùå Start work for the new state
- ‚ùå Spawn agents for the new state
- ‚ùå Assume permission to continue

### STOP PROTOCOL FOR WAVE_COMPLETE:
```markdown
## üõë STATE TRANSITION CHECKPOINT: WAVE_COMPLETE ‚Üí INTEGRATION

### ‚úÖ Current State Work Completed:
- All efforts verified complete with passed reviews
- Wave marked complete in orchestrator-state.yaml
- current_state updated to "INTEGRATION"
- State file committed and pushed

### üìä Current Status:
- Current State: INTEGRATION (already updated in file)
- Previous State: WAVE_COMPLETE
- Wave Status: Complete and validated
- State Files: Updated to INTEGRATION and committed ‚úÖ

### ‚è∏Ô∏è STOPPED - Awaiting User Continuation
State file already updated to INTEGRATION. When you run /continue-orchestrating, 
integration work will begin immediately. Please use /continue-orchestrating.
```

**STOP MEANS STOP - Exit and wait for /continue-orchestrating**

---


## üî¥üî¥üî¥ STOP! STATE RULE READING IS ABSOLUTELY FIRST! üî¥üî¥üî¥

**YOU HAVE ENTERED WAVE_COMPLETE STATE - YOU MUST READ AND ACKNOWLEDGE ALL STATE RULES BEFORE DOING ANY STATE WORK!**

## üî¥üî¥üî¥ R290 VERIFICATION REQUIREMENT üî¥üî¥üî¥

**R290 ENFORCEMENT: CREATE VERIFICATION MARKER AFTER READING**

After reading and acknowledging all state rules, you MUST create a verification marker:

```bash
# MANDATORY: Create verification marker after reading rules
touch .state_rules_read_orchestrator_WAVE_COMPLETE
echo "$(date +%s) - Rules read and acknowledged for WAVE_COMPLETE" > .state_rules_read_orchestrator_WAVE_COMPLETE
```

**FAILURE TO CREATE MARKER = AUTOMATIC -100% PENALTY**

The system will check for this marker. No marker = Immediate failure.

### ‚ùå DO NOT DO ANY WAVE_COMPLETE WORK UNTIL RULES ARE READ:
- ‚ùå Start finalize wave efforts
- ‚ùå Start collect implementation results
- ‚ùå Start prepare integration
- ‚ùå Update state files
- ‚ùå Continue to next state
- ‚ùå Think about what to do in this state

### ‚úÖ YOU MUST IMMEDIATELY:

## üî¥üî¥üî¥ MANDATORY STATE RULE READING AND ACKNOWLEDGMENT üî¥üî¥üî¥

### ‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è YOU MUST READ EACH RULE FILE LISTED IN PRIMARY DIRECTIVES. **I AM WATCHING YOUR TOOL CALLS FOR READ OPERATIONS** *YOU WILL FAIL* IF YOU DO NOT MAKE A READ FILE CALL FOR EACH RULE FILE IN PRIMARY DIRECTIVES!!! ‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è

**AFTER READING, YOU MUST ACKNOWLEDGE ALL THE STATE RULES AND STATE THAT YOU WILL ABIDE BY THEM ONE AT A TIME GIVING THE RULE NUMBER AND DESCRIPTION.**

### ‚ùå ANTI-PATTERNS THAT WILL CAUSE FAILURE:

1. **Fake Acknowledgment Without Reading**:
   ```
   ‚ùå WRONG: "I acknowledge R151, R208, R053..."
   (No Read tool calls detected = AUTOMATIC FAILURE)
   ```

2. **Bulk Acknowledgment**:
   ```
   ‚ùå WRONG: "I acknowledge all WAVE_COMPLETE rules"
   (YOU Must READ AND ACKNOWLEDGE EACH rule individually)
   ```

3. **Silent Reading**:
   ```
   ‚ùå WRONG: [Reads rules but doesn't acknowledge]
   "Now I've read the rules, let me start work..."
   (MUST explicitly acknowledge EACH rule)
   ```

4. **Reading From Memory**:
   ```
   ‚ùå WRONG: "I know R208 requires CD before spawn..."
   (Must READ from file, not recall from memory)
   ```

5. **Skipping Rules in PRIMARY DIRECTIVES**:
   ```
   ‚ùå WRONG: Reading only some rules from the list
   (ALL rules in PRIMARY DIRECTIVES are MANDATORY)
   ```

### ‚úÖ CORRECT PATTERN FOR WAVE_COMPLETE:
```
1. READ: $CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/rule-library/[first-rule-file].md
2. "I acknowledge [Rule#] - [Rule Name]: [Brief description]"
3. READ: $CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/rule-library/[second-rule-file].md  
4. "I acknowledge [Rule#] - [Rule Name]: [Brief description]"
[Continue for EVERY rule in PRIMARY DIRECTIVES...]
5. "Ready to execute WAVE_COMPLETE work"
```

### üö® NO WORK UNTIL ACKNOWLEDGMENT COMPLETE üö®
**You may NOT begin ANY WAVE_COMPLETE work until:**
1. ‚úÖ ALL rules in PRIMARY DIRECTIVES have been READ
2. ‚úÖ ALL rules have been individually ACKNOWLEDGED
3. ‚úÖ You have stated readiness to execute WAVE_COMPLETE work
1. **READ** every rule file listed in PRIMARY DIRECTIVES below
2. **ACKNOWLEDGE** each rule individually with number and description
3. **ONLY THEN** proceed with WAVE_COMPLETE work

### üö® FAILURE TO READ STATE RULES FIRST = IMMEDIATE EXIT üö®
**If you do ANY WAVE_COMPLETE work before reading and acknowledging rules:**
- **STOP ALL WORK IMMEDIATELY**
- **EXIT WITH FAILURE STATUS**
- **YOU HAVE VIOLATED STATE COMPLIANCE**

**THE SYSTEM IS MONITORING YOUR READ TOOL CALLS!**

## üìã PRIMARY DIRECTIVES FOR WAVE_COMPLETE

**YOU MUST READ EACH RULE LISTED HERE. YOUR READ TOOL CALLS ARE BEING MONITORED.**

### State-Specific Rules (NOT in orchestrator.md):
1. **R222** - Code Review Gate
   - File: `$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/rule-library/R222-code-review-gate.md`
   - Criticality: BLOCKING - ALL reviews must pass before proceeding

2. **R105** - Wave Completion Protocol
   - File: `$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/rule-library/R105-wave-completion-protocol.md`
   - Criticality: INFO - Best practices for wave completion

3. **R035** - Phase Completion Testing
   - File: `$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/rule-library/R035-phase-completion-testing.md`
   - Criticality: MANDATORY - Validation requirements

**Note**: R288 (state updates), R287 (TODO saves) are already in orchestrator.md.

## üìã RULE SUMMARY FOR WAVE_COMPLETE STATE

### Rules Enforced in This State:
- R222: Code Review Gate [BLOCKING - ALL reviews must pass]
- R288: State File Update and Commit [SUPREME LAW - Update immediately, includes commit/push]
- R105: Wave Completion Protocol [INFO - Best practice]
- R035: Phase Completion Testing [MANDATORY - Validation required]
- R287: TODO Save Triggers [BLOCKING - Save on completion]

### Critical Requirements:
1. Verify ALL reviews passed (R222) - Penalty: -100%
2. Verify ALL size compliance (<800 lines) - Penalty: -100%
3. Update state file immediately - Penalty: -50%
4. Save and commit TODOs - Penalty: -20%
5. Prepare for INTEGRATION state transition - Penalty: -10%

### Success Criteria:
- ‚úÖ ALL efforts have PASSED code reviews
- ‚úÖ ALL efforts are size compliant
- ‚úÖ State file updated with completion
- ‚úÖ Ready to transition to INTEGRATION state
- ‚úÖ TODOs saved and committed

### Failure Triggers:
- ‚ùå Enter with ANY failed review = R222 VIOLATION
- ‚ùå Enter with size violations = AUTOMATIC FAILURE
- ‚ùå Skip state file update = R288 VIOLATION
- ‚ùå Forget TODO saves = -20% penalty

## üö® WAVE_COMPLETE IS A VERB - START WAVE COMPLETION PROCESS IMMEDIATELY! üö®

### IMMEDIATE ACTIONS UPON ENTERING WAVE_COMPLETE

**THE MOMENT YOU ENTER THIS STATE, YOU MUST:**
1. Verify all efforts are complete and passed reviews
2. Update orchestrator-state.yaml with completion
3. Check TodoWrite for pending items and process them
4. Prepare to transition to INTEGRATION state

**FORBIDDEN - AUTOMATIC FAILURE:**
- ‚ùå "STATE TRANSITION COMPLETE: Now in WAVE_COMPLETE" [stops]
- ‚ùå "Successfully entered WAVE_COMPLETE state" [waits]
- ‚ùå "Ready to start wave completion process" [pauses]
- ‚ùå "I'm in WAVE_COMPLETE state" [does nothing]

**REQUIRED - IMMEDIATE ACTION:**
- ‚úÖ "Entering WAVE_COMPLETE, verifying all efforts complete..."
- ‚úÖ "START WAVE COMPLETION PROCESS, update orchestrator-state.yaml with completion..."
- ‚úÖ "WAVE_COMPLETE: Validating all reviews passed before proceeding..."

## State Context
You have completed all efforts in a wave and need to validate completion and prepare for next steps.

**NOTE: Integration branch creation happens in the INTEGRATION state, not here!**
- This state validates that all efforts are complete
- The INTEGRATION state handles creating integration branches
- See state machine: WAVE_COMPLETE ‚Üí INTEGRATION

## üî¥üî¥üî¥ R222 CODE REVIEW GATE - ABSOLUTELY MANDATORY üî¥üî¥üî¥

**YOU CANNOT BE IN THIS STATE UNLESS:**
1. **ALL** Code Reviews have been run
2. **ALL** Code Reviews have PASSED
3. **ALL** Size compliance checks PASSED (<800 lines)
4. **NO** effort is in FIX_ISSUES state
5. **NO** effort has pending review issues

### MANDATORY VERIFICATION BEFORE PROCEEDING:
```bash
# R222 ENFORCEMENT - MUST CHECK EVERY EFFORT!
echo "üîç R222: Verifying ALL reviews passed..."
ALL_PASSED=true

for effort in $WAVE_EFFORTS; do
    REVIEW_STATUS=$(check_effort_review_status "$effort")
    SIZE_STATUS=$(check_effort_size_compliance "$effort")
    
    if [ "$REVIEW_STATUS" != "PASSED" ]; then
        echo "‚ùå R222 VIOLATION: $effort review status: $REVIEW_STATUS"
        echo "üö´ CANNOT BE IN WAVE_COMPLETE STATE!"
        echo "üîÑ Must return to MONITOR and fix issues"
        ALL_PASSED=false
    fi
    
    if [ "$SIZE_STATUS" != "COMPLIANT" ]; then
        echo "‚ùå SIZE VIOLATION: $effort exceeds 800 lines!"
        echo "üö´ CANNOT BE IN WAVE_COMPLETE STATE!"
        ALL_PASSED=false
    fi
done

if [ "$ALL_PASSED" = false ]; then
    echo "üî¥üî¥üî¥ CRITICAL: INVALID STATE TRANSITION!"
    echo "Must return to MONITOR and execute review-fix loops"
    exit 222
fi

echo "‚úÖ R222 VERIFIED: All reviews passed, proceeding with completion"
```

## üî¥üî¥üî¥ CRITICAL: MANDATORY STATE FILE UPDATE (R288) üî¥üî¥üî¥

### IMMEDIATELY upon entering WAVE_COMPLETE state:

```bash
# 1. Update state machine
update_orchestrator_state "WAVE_COMPLETE" "All efforts reviewed and passed"

# 2. Mark wave as complete in state file
mark_wave_complete "$PHASE" "$WAVE"

# Example state file update:

# 3. üî¥üî¥üî¥ CRITICAL: UPDATE STATE TO INTEGRATION BEFORE STOPPING! üî¥üî¥üî¥
# Per state machine: WAVE_COMPLETE ‚Üí INTEGRATION is the REQUIRED transition
echo "üìù Updating current_state to INTEGRATION for next continuation..."

yq -i ".transition_reason = \"Wave $WAVE complete, all reviews passed, ready for integration\"" orchestrator-state.yaml
echo "‚úÖ State updated to INTEGRATION - will execute integration work on next /continue-orchestrating"

# R301 MANDATORY: Update current_wave_integration
echo "üìù Updating current_wave_integration per R301..."

# Deprecate existing wave integration if it exists
EXISTING_WAVE=$(yq ".current_wave_integration | select(.phase == $PHASE and .wave == $WAVE)" orchestrator-state.yaml)
if [ ! -z "$EXISTING_WAVE" ]; then
    yq -i ".deprecated_wave_integrations += (.current_wave_integration | select(.phase == $PHASE and .wave == $WAVE))" orchestrator-state.yaml
fi

# Set the NEW current wave integration

  \"type\": \"initial\"
}" orchestrator-state.yaml

echo "‚úÖ Current wave integration updated per R301"
```

**VIOLATION = AUTOMATIC FAILURE if wave completion not recorded in state file!**
**VIOLATION = AUTOMATIC FAILURE if current_wave_integration not updated per R301!**

### R287-R287 TODO PERSISTENCE ON COMPLETION
```bash
# R287: Major milestone trigger - save TODOs
echo "üíæ R287: Wave complete - saving TODOs..."
save_todos "WAVE_COMPLETE - Phase $PHASE Wave $WAVE"

# R287: Commit within 60 seconds
cd $CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR
git add todos/*.todo orchestrator-state.yaml
git commit -m "todo: wave $WAVE complete, all reviews passed"

## State Transitions

### üî¥üî¥üî¥ CRITICAL: DEFAULT TRANSITION IS TO INTEGRATION! üî¥üî¥üî¥

**UNLESS OTHERWISE DETERMINED, WAVE_COMPLETE ALWAYS TRANSITIONS TO INTEGRATION:**
1. Update current_state to "INTEGRATION" in orchestrator-state.yaml
2. Commit and push the state file
3. STOP per R322 and wait for /continue-orchestrating
4. When user continues, orchestrator will be in INTEGRATION state and execute integration work

From WAVE_COMPLETE state, the STANDARD transition is:
- **DEFAULT** ‚Üí **INTEGRATION** (Always go here unless special conditions below)

Special condition transitions (RARE):
- **ARCHITECT_REVIEW_REQUIRED** ‚Üí WAVE_REVIEW (Only if architect review explicitly needed)
- **SPLITS_REQUIRED** ‚Üí SPAWN_AGENTS (Only if size violations detected)
- **NEXT_WAVE_READY** ‚Üí WAVE_START (Only if skipping integration - VERY RARE)
- **PHASE_COMPLETE** ‚Üí WAVE_REVIEW (Only at end of phase)

## R322 VIOLATION DETECTION

If you find yourself:
- Starting work for a new state without /continue-orchestrating
- Transitioning without stopping after state file commit
- Continuing after completing state work

**STOP IMMEDIATELY - You are violating R322!**
