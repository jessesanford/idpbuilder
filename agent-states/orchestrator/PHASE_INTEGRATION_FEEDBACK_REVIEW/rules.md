# Orchestrator - PHASE_INTEGRATION_FEEDBACK_REVIEW State Rules

## üõëüõëüõë R322 MANDATORY STOP BEFORE STATE TRANSITIONS üõëüõëüõë

**SUPREME LAW - VIOLATION = -100% IMMEDIATE FAILURE**

### YOU MUST STOP AFTER:
1. ‚úÖ Completing all TODOs for this state
2. ‚úÖ Updating orchestrator-state.json with new state
3. ‚úÖ Committing and pushing the state file  
4. ‚úÖ Providing work summary

### STOP PROTOCOL:
```markdown
## üõë STATE TRANSITION CHECKPOINT: CURRENT_STATE ‚Üí NEXT_STATE

### ‚úÖ Current State Work Completed:
- [List completed work]

### üìä Current Status:
- Current State: CURRENT_STATE
- Next State: NEXT_STATE
- TODOs Completed: X/Y
- State Files: Updated and committed ‚úÖ

### ‚è∏Ô∏è STOPPED - Awaiting User Continuation
Ready to transition to NEXT_STATE. Please use /continue-orchestrating.
```

**STOP MEANS STOP - Exit and wait for /continue-orchestrating**

## üî¥üî¥üî¥ R290 ENFORCEMENT: READ THESE RULES FIRST! üî¥üî¥üî¥

**SUPREME LAW #3 (R290): STATE RULES MUST BE READ BEFORE STATE ACTIONS**

## üî¥üî¥üî¥ STOP! STATE RULE READING IS ABSOLUTELY FIRST! üî¥üî¥üî¥

**YOU HAVE ENTERED PHASE_INTEGRATION_FEEDBACK_REVIEW STATE - YOU MUST READ AND ACKNOWLEDGE ALL STATE RULES BEFORE DOING ANY STATE WORK!**

## üî¥üî¥üî¥ R290 VERIFICATION REQUIREMENT üî¥üî¥üî¥

**R290 ENFORCEMENT: CREATE VERIFICATION MARKER AFTER READING**

After reading and acknowledging all state rules, you MUST create a verification marker:

```bash
# MANDATORY: Create verification marker after reading rules
touch .state_rules_read_orchestrator_PHASE_INTEGRATION_FEEDBACK_REVIEW
echo "$(date +%s) - Rules read and acknowledged for PHASE_INTEGRATION_FEEDBACK_REVIEW" > .state_rules_read_orchestrator_PHASE_INTEGRATION_FEEDBACK_REVIEW
```

**FAILURE TO CREATE MARKER = AUTOMATIC -100% PENALTY**

The system will check for this marker. No marker = Immediate failure.

### ‚ùå DO NOT DO ANY PHASE FEEDBACK WORK UNTIL RULES ARE READ:
- ‚ùå Parse phase integration reports
- ‚ùå Identify failed waves
- ‚ùå Extract conflict information
- ‚ùå Create fix request metadata
- ‚ùå Update state files
- ‚ùå Continue to next state
- ‚ùå Think about what to do in this state

### ‚úÖ YOU MUST IMMEDIATELY:

## üî¥üî¥üî¥ MANDATORY STATE RULE READING AND ACKNOWLEDGMENT üî¥üî¥üî¥

### ‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è YOU MUST READ EACH RULE FILE LISTED IN PRIMARY DIRECTIVES. **I AM WATCHING YOUR TOOL CALLS FOR READ OPERATIONS** *YOU WILL FAIL* IF YOU DO NOT MAKE A READ FILE CALL FOR EACH RULE FILE IN PRIMARY DIRECTIVES!!! ‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è

**AFTER READING, YOU MUST ACKNOWLEDGE ALL THE STATE RULES AND STATE THAT YOU WILL ABIDE BY THEM ONE AT A TIME GIVING THE RULE NUMBER AND DESCRIPTION.**

### PRIMARY DIRECTIVES - MANDATORY READING:

### üõë RULE R322 - Mandatory Stop Before State Transitions
**Source:** $CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/rule-library/R322-mandatory-stop-before-state-transitions.md
**Criticality:** üî¥üî¥üî¥ SUPREME LAW - Violation = -100% FAILURE

After completing state work and committing state file:
1. STOP IMMEDIATELY
2. Do NOT continue to next state
3. Do NOT start new work
4. Exit and wait for user

**USE THESE EXACT READ COMMANDS (IN THIS ORDER):**
1. Read: $CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/rule-library/R234-mandatory-state-traversal-supreme-law.md
2. Read: $CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/rule-library/R006-orchestrator-never-writes-code.md
3. Read: $CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/rule-library/R290-state-rule-reading-verification-supreme-law.md
5. Read: $CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/rule-library/R282-phase-integration-protocol.md
6. Read: $CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/rule-library/R238-integration-report-evaluation.md
7. Read: $CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/rule-library/R239-fix-plan-distribution.md
8. Read: $CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/rule-library/R206-state-machine-transition-validation.md

**WE ARE WATCHING EACH READ TOOL CALL**

### ‚ùå ANTI-PATTERNS THAT WILL CAUSE FAILURE:

1. **Fake Acknowledgment Without Reading**:
   ```
   ‚ùå WRONG: "I acknowledge R234, R208, R290..."
   (No Read tool calls detected = AUTOMATIC FAILURE)
   ```

2. **Bulk Acknowledgment**:
   ```
   ‚ùå WRONG: "I acknowledge all PHASE_INTEGRATION_FEEDBACK_REVIEW rules"
   (YOU Must READ AND ACKNOWLEDGE EACH rule individually)
   ```

3. **Silent Reading**:
   ```
   ‚ùå WRONG: [Reads rules but doesn't acknowledge]
   "Now I've read the rules, let me start work..."
   (MUST explicitly acknowledge EACH rule)
   ```

4. **Reading From Memory**:
   ```
   ‚ùå WRONG: "I know R282 requires phase integration..."
   (Must READ from file, not recall from memory)
   ```

5. **Skipping Rules in PRIMARY DIRECTIVES**:
   ```
   ‚ùå WRONG: Reading only some rules from the list
   (ALL rules in PRIMARY DIRECTIVES are MANDATORY)
   ```

### ‚úÖ CORRECT PATTERN FOR PHASE_INTEGRATION_FEEDBACK_REVIEW:
```
1. READ: $CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/rule-library/R234-mandatory-state-traversal-supreme-law.md
2. "I acknowledge R234 - Mandatory State Traversal: [Brief description]"
3. READ: $CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/rule-library/R006-orchestrator-never-writes-code.md  
4. "I acknowledge R006 - Orchestrator Never Writes Code: [Brief description]"
[Continue for EVERY rule in PRIMARY DIRECTIVES...]
5. Create verification marker
6. "Ready to execute PHASE_INTEGRATION_FEEDBACK_REVIEW work"
```

### üö® NO WORK UNTIL ACKNOWLEDGMENT COMPLETE üö®
**You may NOT begin ANY phase feedback work until:**
1. ‚úÖ ALL rules in PRIMARY DIRECTIVES have been READ
2. ‚úÖ ALL rules have been individually ACKNOWLEDGED
3. ‚úÖ Verification marker has been created
4. ‚úÖ You have stated readiness to execute PHASE_INTEGRATION_FEEDBACK_REVIEW work

### üö® FAILURE TO READ STATE RULES FIRST = IMMEDIATE EXIT üö®
**If you do ANY phase feedback work before reading and acknowledging rules:**
- **STOP ALL WORK IMMEDIATELY**
- **EXIT WITH FAILURE STATUS**
- **YOU HAVE VIOLATED STATE COMPLIANCE**

## üî¥üî¥üî¥ SUPREME DIRECTIVE: ANALYZE PHASE INTEGRATION FAILURES üî¥üî¥üî¥

**PARSE PHASE-LEVEL INTEGRATION FAILURES AND INITIATE FIXES!**

## State Overview

In PHASE_INTEGRATION_FEEDBACK_REVIEW, you analyze phase integration report to identify which waves/efforts failed at the phase level.

## Required Actions

### 1. Parse Phase Integration Report
```bash
PHASE=$(jq '.current_phase' orchestrator-state.json)
REPORT_FILE="efforts/phase${PHASE}/phase-integration/PHASE_INTEGRATION_REPORT.md"

echo "üìã Parsing phase integration report: $REPORT_FILE"

# Extract failed waves and conflicts
FAILED_WAVES=()
CONFLICT_FILES=()
MISSING_DEPS=()

# Parse Failed Waves section
while IFS= read -r line; do
    if [[ "$line" =~ ^-[[:space:]]+wave([0-9]+):[[:space:]]+(.+) ]]; then
        WAVE_NUM="${BASH_REMATCH[1]}"
        ISSUE="${BASH_REMATCH[2]}"
        FAILED_WAVES+=("wave${WAVE_NUM}:${ISSUE}")
    fi
done < <(sed -n '/## Failed Waves/,/## /p' "$REPORT_FILE" | grep "^-")

# Parse Merge Conflicts section
while IFS= read -r line; do
    if [[ "$line" =~ ^-[[:space:]]+(.+) ]]; then
        CONFLICT_FILES+=("${BASH_REMATCH[1]}")
    fi
done < <(sed -n '/## Merge Conflicts/,/## /p' "$REPORT_FILE" | grep "^-")

# Parse Missing Dependencies
if grep -q "Missing Dependencies:" "$REPORT_FILE"; then
    while IFS= read -r dep; do
        MISSING_DEPS+=("$dep")
    done < <(sed -n '/## Missing Dependencies/,/## /p' "$REPORT_FILE" | grep "^-" | sed 's/^- //')
fi

echo "Failed waves: ${#FAILED_WAVES[@]}"
echo "Conflict files: ${#CONFLICT_FILES[@]}"
echo "Missing dependencies: ${#MISSING_DEPS[@]}"
```

### 2. Create Phase Fix Request
```bash
TIMESTAMP=$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S)
PHASE_FIX_REQUEST="efforts/phase${PHASE}/PHASE_FIX_REQUEST_${TIMESTAMP}.yaml"

cat > "$PHASE_FIX_REQUEST" << EOF
phase_fix_request:
  timestamp: "$(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)"
  phase: $PHASE
  integration_report: "$REPORT_FILE"
  
  failed_waves:
EOF

for wave_issue in "${FAILED_WAVES[@]}"; do
    WAVE="${wave_issue%%:*}"
    ISSUE="${wave_issue#*:}"
    cat >> "$PHASE_FIX_REQUEST" << EOF
    - wave: "$WAVE"
      issue: "$ISSUE"
      directory: "efforts/phase${PHASE}/${WAVE}"
EOF
done

if [ ${#CONFLICT_FILES[@]} -gt 0 ]; then
    cat >> "$PHASE_FIX_REQUEST" << EOF
  
  merge_conflicts:
EOF
    for file in "${CONFLICT_FILES[@]}"; do
        echo "    - \"$file\"" >> "$PHASE_FIX_REQUEST"
    done
fi

if [ ${#MISSING_DEPS[@]} -gt 0 ]; then
    cat >> "$PHASE_FIX_REQUEST" << EOF
  
  missing_dependencies:
EOF
    for dep in "${MISSING_DEPS[@]}"; do
        echo "    - \"$dep\"" >> "$PHASE_FIX_REQUEST"
    done
fi

cat >> "$PHASE_FIX_REQUEST" << EOF
  
  fix_strategy:
    - resolve_conflicts: ${#CONFLICT_FILES[@]} files
    - install_dependencies: ${#MISSING_DEPS[@]} packages
    - fix_failed_waves: ${#FAILED_WAVES[@]} waves
EOF

echo "‚úÖ Created phase fix request: $PHASE_FIX_REQUEST"
```

### 3. Update State and Transition
```bash
# Record in state file
jq ".phase_integration_feedback.phase${PHASE}.report_parsed = \"$(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)\"" -i orchestrator-state.json
jq ".phase_integration_feedback.phase${PHASE}.fix_request_file = \"$PHASE_FIX_REQUEST\"" -i orchestrator-state.json
jq '.phase_integration_feedback.phase${PHASE}.failed_waves = ${#FAILED_WAVES[@]}' orchestrator-state.json > tmp.json && mv tmp.json orchestrator-state.json
jq '.phase_integration_feedback.phase${PHASE}.conflicts = ${#CONFLICT_FILES[@]}' orchestrator-state.json > tmp.json && mv tmp.json orchestrator-state.json

# Determine next state
if [ ${#FAILED_WAVES[@]} -gt 0 ] || [ ${#CONFLICT_FILES[@]} -gt 0 ] || [ ${#MISSING_DEPS[@]} -gt 0 ]; then
    echo "üîß Phase integration issues found - spawning Code Reviewer for fix planning"
    UPDATE_STATE="SPAWN_CODE_REVIEWER_PHASE_FIX_PLAN"
    UPDATE_REASON="Phase integration issues require fix plans"
else
    echo "‚úÖ No phase integration issues - proceeding to next phase"
    UPDATE_STATE="PHASE_COMPLETE"
    UPDATE_REASON="Phase integration successful"
fi

# Update state
jq ".current_state = \"$UPDATE_STATE\"" -i orchestrator-state.json
jq ".state_transition_history += [{\"from\": \"PHASE_INTEGRATION_FEEDBACK_REVIEW\", \"to\": \"$UPDATE_STATE\", \"timestamp\": \"$(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)\", \"reason\": \"$UPDATE_REASON\"}]" -i orchestrator-state.json

# Commit
git add orchestrator-state.json "$PHASE_FIX_REQUEST"
git commit -m "state: Phase feedback review complete - $UPDATE_REASON"
git push
```

## Valid Transitions

1. **FIX NEEDED Path**: `PHASE_INTEGRATION_FEEDBACK_REVIEW` ‚Üí `SPAWN_CODE_REVIEWER_PHASE_FIX_PLAN`
   - When: Phase integration has failures requiring fixes
   
2. **SUCCESS Path**: `PHASE_INTEGRATION_FEEDBACK_REVIEW` ‚Üí `PHASE_COMPLETE`
   - When: Phase integration is successful with no issues

## Grading Criteria

- ‚úÖ **+25%**: Parse phase integration report correctly
- ‚úÖ **+25%**: Create comprehensive fix request
- ‚úÖ **+25%**: Update state file properly
- ‚úÖ **+25%**: Transition to correct next state

## Common Violations

- ‚ùå **-100%**: Not parsing integration report
- ‚ùå **-50%**: Missing fix request creation
- ‚ùå **-50%**: Wrong state transition
- ‚ùå **-30%**: Not recording metadata

- R238: Integration Report Evaluation Protocol
- R239: Fix Plan Distribution Protocol
- R206: State Machine Transition Validation

## üî¥üî¥üî¥ MANDATORY MEASUREMENT RULE - R304 üî¥üî¥üî¥

**ABSOLUTE REQUIREMENTS:**
- ‚úÖ MUST use `$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/tools/line-counter.sh` for ALL line counting
- ‚ùå NEVER use `wc -l` or any manual counting method
- ‚ùå NEVER count lines any other way - this is a -100% automatic failure
- ‚úÖ MUST specify both -b (base branch) and -c (current branch) parameters
- ‚úÖ Base branch MUST be phase integration branch (NOT "main")

**Failure to use the line counter tool = AUTOMATIC -100% GRADE**

## R322 VIOLATION DETECTION

If you find yourself:
- Starting work for a new state without /continue-orchestrating
- Transitioning without stopping after state file commit
- Continuing after completing state work

**STOP IMMEDIATELY - You are violating R322!**
