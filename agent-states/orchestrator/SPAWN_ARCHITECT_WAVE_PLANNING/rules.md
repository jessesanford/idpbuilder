# Orchestrator - SPAWN_ARCHITECT_WAVE_PLANNING State Rules

## üî¥üî¥üî¥ STOP! STATE RULE READING IS ABSOLUTELY FIRST! üî¥üî¥üî¥

**YOU HAVE ENTERED SPAWN_ARCHITECT_WAVE_PLANNING STATE - YOU MUST READ AND ACKNOWLEDGE ALL STATE RULES BEFORE DOING ANY STATE WORK!**

## üî¥üî¥üî¥ R290 VERIFICATION REQUIREMENT üî¥üî¥üî¥

**R290 ENFORCEMENT: CREATE VERIFICATION MARKER AFTER READING**

After reading and acknowledging all state rules, you MUST create a verification marker:

```bash
# MANDATORY: Create verification marker after reading rules
touch .state_rules_read_orchestrator_SPAWN_ARCHITECT_WAVE_PLANNING
echo "$(date +%s) - Rules read and acknowledged for SPAWN_ARCHITECT_WAVE_PLANNING" > .state_rules_read_orchestrator_SPAWN_ARCHITECT_WAVE_PLANNING
```

**FAILURE TO CREATE MARKER = AUTOMATIC -100% PENALTY**

The system will check for this marker. No marker = Immediate failure.

### ‚ùå DO NOT DO ANY SPAWN_ARCHITECT_WAVE_PLANNING WORK UNTIL RULES ARE READ:
- ‚ùå Start spawn architect agent
- ‚ùå Start request wave planning
- ‚ùå Start generate wave strategy
- ‚ùå Update state files
- ‚ùå Continue to next state
- ‚ùå Think about what to do in this state

### ‚úÖ YOU MUST IMMEDIATELY:

## üî¥üî¥üî¥ MANDATORY STATE RULE READING AND ACKNOWLEDGMENT üî¥üî¥üî¥

### ‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è YOU MUST READ EACH RULE FILE LISTED IN PRIMARY DIRECTIVES. **I AM WATCHING YOUR TOOL CALLS FOR READ OPERATIONS** *YOU WILL FAIL* IF YOU DO NOT MAKE A READ FILE CALL FOR EACH RULE FILE IN PRIMARY DIRECTIVES!!! ‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è

**AFTER READING, YOU MUST ACKNOWLEDGE ALL THE STATE RULES AND STATE THAT YOU WILL ABIDE BY THEM ONE AT A TIME GIVING THE RULE NUMBER AND DESCRIPTION.**

### ‚ùå ANTI-PATTERNS THAT WILL CAUSE FAILURE:

1. **Fake Acknowledgment Without Reading**:
   ```
   ‚ùå WRONG: "I acknowledge R151, R208, R053..."
   (No Read tool calls detected = AUTOMATIC FAILURE)
   ```

2. **Bulk Acknowledgment**:
   ```
   ‚ùå WRONG: "I acknowledge all SPAWN_ARCHITECT_WAVE_PLANNING rules"
   (YOU Must READ AND ACKNOWLEDGE EACH rule individually)
   ```

3. **Silent Reading**:
   ```
   ‚ùå WRONG: [Reads rules but doesn't acknowledge]
   "Now I've read the rules, let me start work..."
   (MUST explicitly acknowledge EACH rule)
   ```

4. **Reading From Memory**:
   ```
   ‚ùå WRONG: "I know R208 requires CD before spawn..."
   (Must READ from file, not recall from memory)
   ```

5. **Skipping Rules in PRIMARY DIRECTIVES**:
   ```
   ‚ùå WRONG: Reading only some rules from the list
   (ALL rules in PRIMARY DIRECTIVES are MANDATORY)
   ```

### ‚úÖ CORRECT PATTERN FOR SPAWN_ARCHITECT_WAVE_PLANNING:
```
1. READ: $CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/rule-library/[first-rule-file].md
2. "I acknowledge [Rule#] - [Rule Name]: [Brief description]"
3. READ: $CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/rule-library/[second-rule-file].md  
4. "I acknowledge [Rule#] - [Rule Name]: [Brief description]"
[Continue for EVERY rule in PRIMARY DIRECTIVES...]
5. "Ready to execute SPAWN_ARCHITECT_WAVE_PLANNING work"
```

### üö® NO WORK UNTIL ACKNOWLEDGMENT COMPLETE üö®
**You may NOT begin ANY SPAWN_ARCHITECT_WAVE_PLANNING work until:**
1. ‚úÖ ALL rules in PRIMARY DIRECTIVES have been READ
2. ‚úÖ ALL rules have been individually ACKNOWLEDGED
3. ‚úÖ You have stated readiness to execute SPAWN_ARCHITECT_WAVE_PLANNING work
1. **READ** every rule file listed in PRIMARY DIRECTIVES below
2. **ACKNOWLEDGE** each rule individually with number and description
3. **ONLY THEN** proceed with SPAWN_ARCHITECT_WAVE_PLANNING work

### üö® FAILURE TO READ STATE RULES FIRST = IMMEDIATE EXIT üö®
**If you do ANY SPAWN_ARCHITECT_WAVE_PLANNING work before reading and acknowledging rules:**
- **STOP ALL WORK IMMEDIATELY**
- **EXIT WITH FAILURE STATUS**
- **YOU HAVE VIOLATED STATE COMPLIANCE**

**THE SYSTEM IS MONITORING YOUR READ TOOL CALLS!**

## üö® SPAWN_ARCHITECT_WAVE_PLANNING IS A VERB - START SPAWNING ARCHITECT IMMEDIATELY! üö®

### IMMEDIATE ACTIONS UPON ENTERING SPAWN_ARCHITECT_WAVE_PLANNING

**THE MOMENT YOU ENTER THIS STATE, YOU MUST:**
1. Spawn Architect with Wave planning request NOW
2. Include wave requirements in spawn message
3. Check TodoWrite for pending items and process them
4. Provide phase plan context immediately

**FORBIDDEN - AUTOMATIC FAILURE:**
- ‚ùå "STATE TRANSITION COMPLETE: Now in SPAWN_ARCHITECT_WAVE_PLANNING" [stops]
- ‚ùå "Successfully entered SPAWN_ARCHITECT_WAVE_PLANNING state" [waits]
- ‚ùå "Ready to start spawning architect" [pauses]
- ‚ùå "I'm in SPAWN_ARCHITECT_WAVE_PLANNING state" [does nothing]

**REQUIRED - IMMEDIATE ACTION:**
- ‚úÖ "Entering SPAWN_ARCHITECT_WAVE_PLANNING, Spawn Architect with Wave planning request NOW..."
- ‚úÖ "START SPAWNING ARCHITECT, include wave requirements in spawn message..."
- ‚úÖ "SPAWN_ARCHITECT_WAVE_PLANNING: Provide phase plan context immediately..."

## State Context

## üî¥üî¥üî¥ MANDATORY MEASUREMENT RULE - R304 üî¥üî¥üî¥

### R304: Mandatory Line Counter Tool Enforcement
**File**: `$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/rule-library/R304-mandatory-line-counter-enforcement.md`
**Criticality**: BLOCKING - Manual counting = AUTOMATIC -100% FAILURE

**ABSOLUTE REQUIREMENTS:**
- ‚úÖ MUST use `$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/tools/line-counter.sh` for ALL line counting
- ‚ùå NEVER use `wc -l` or any manual counting method
- ‚ùå NEVER count lines any other way - this is a -100% automatic failure
- ‚úÖ MUST specify both -b (base branch) and -c (current branch) parameters
- ‚úÖ Base branch MUST be phase integration branch (NOT "main")

**Failure to use the line counter tool = AUTOMATIC -100% GRADE**

## State-Specific Rules
No additional state-specific rules are defined for this state at this time.

## General Responsibilities
Follow all general orchestrator rules and the Software Factory state machine.

## Next Steps
Proceed with the standard workflow for the SPAWN_ARCHITECT_WAVE_PLANNING state as defined in the state machine.

## R322 VIOLATION DETECTION

If you find yourself:
- Starting work for a new state without /continue-orchestrating
- Transitioning without stopping after state file commit
- Continuing after completing state work

**STOP IMMEDIATELY - You are violating R322!**
