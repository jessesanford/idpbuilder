# WAITING_FOR_MERGE_PLAN State Rules

## State Purpose
Actively monitor Code Reviewer creating wave merge plan. Check for completion and validate the merge plan meets requirements.

## Critical Rules

### üî¥üî¥üî¥ RULE R322: MANDATORY STOP BEFORE STATE TRANSITION (SUPREME LAW)
- **STOP** and save state before ANY transition
- **READ** orchestrator-state.yaml to verify current state
- **VALIDATE** next state exists in SOFTWARE-FACTORY-STATE-MACHINE.md
- **VIOLATION = IMMEDIATE FAILURE**

### üî¥üî¥üî¥ RULE R233: IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED (SUPREME LAW)
- **NO PASSIVE WAITING** - Must actively check for completion
- **IMMEDIATE ACTION** - Start checking within first response
- **CONTINUOUS MONITORING** - Check every 30-60 seconds
- **States are VERBS** - "WAITING" means "ACTIVELY CHECKING"

### üö®üö®üö® RULE R290: STATE RULE VERIFICATION (BLOCKING)
- **MUST** verify this rules file exists and is loaded
- **MUST** acknowledge all rules before proceeding
- **MUST** validate state transitions against state machine

### üö®üö®üö® RULE R232: MONITOR STATE REQUIREMENTS (BLOCKING)
- **MUST** check TodoWrite for pending items BEFORE transition
- **MUST** process ALL pending items immediately
- **NO** "I will..." statements - only "I am..." with action
- **VIOLATION = AUTOMATIC FAILURE**

### ‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è RULE R269: MERGE PLAN VALIDATION (WARNING)
- Merge plan MUST exist as WAVE-MERGE-PLAN.md
- Plan MUST list all effort branches in order
- Plan MUST specify merge strategy
- Plan MUST identify potential conflicts

### ‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è RULE R287: TODO PERSISTENCE (WARNING)
- **MUST** save TODOs every 10 messages or 15 minutes
- **MUST** save before state transition
- **MUST** commit and push TODO state

## Required Actions

1. **Initial Check (IMMEDIATE)**
   ```bash
   # Check if Code Reviewer was spawned
   grep "spawned_agents" orchestrator-state.yaml
   
   # Verify wave integration directory
   ls -la wave-*-integration/
   ```

2. **Active Monitoring Loop**
   ```bash
   # Get integration workspace location
   PHASE=$(yq '.current_phase' orchestrator-state.yaml)
   WAVE=$(yq '.current_wave' orchestrator-state.yaml)
   INTEGRATION_DIR="/efforts/phase${PHASE}/wave${WAVE}/integration-workspace"
   
   # Check for merge plan existence in the integration workspace
   while true; do
     if [ -f "${INTEGRATION_DIR}/WAVE-MERGE-PLAN.md" ]; then
       echo "‚úì Merge plan detected at $(date)"
       echo "üìç Location: ${INTEGRATION_DIR}/WAVE-MERGE-PLAN.md"
       break
     fi
     
     # Check agent status (if status file exists in integration workspace)
     if [ -f "${INTEGRATION_DIR}/status.yaml" ]; then
       STATUS=$(grep "status:" "${INTEGRATION_DIR}/status.yaml" | awk '{print $2}')
       echo "Code Reviewer status: $STATUS"
       
       if [ "$STATUS" = "COMPLETED" ]; then
         echo "‚úì Code Reviewer completed"
         break
       elif [ "$STATUS" = "BLOCKED" ]; then
         echo "‚úó Code Reviewer blocked - need intervention"
         # Transition to ERROR_RECOVERY
         break
       fi
     fi
     
     echo "Waiting for merge plan in ${INTEGRATION_DIR}... checking again in 30s"
     sleep 30
   done
   ```

3. **Validate Merge Plan Contents**
   ```bash
   # Once plan exists, validate it
   PLAN_FILE="${INTEGRATION_DIR}/WAVE-MERGE-PLAN.md"
   
   # Check plan has required sections
   grep -q "## Merge Order" "$PLAN_FILE" || echo "‚úó Missing merge order"
   grep -q "## Effort Branches" "$PLAN_FILE" || echo "‚úó Missing effort list"
   grep -q "## Merge Strategy" "$PLAN_FILE" || echo "‚úó Missing strategy"
   grep -q "## Potential Conflicts" "$PLAN_FILE" || echo "‚úó Missing conflict analysis"
   
   # Count effort branches in plan
   EFFORT_COUNT=$(grep -c "effort-" "$PLAN_FILE")
   echo "Plan includes $EFFORT_COUNT efforts"
   ```

4. **Check for Timeout**
   ```bash
   # Get spawn time
   SPAWN_TIME=$(grep "spawned_agents" orchestrator-state.yaml -A 5 | grep "timestamp" | tail -1 | cut -d'"' -f2)
   
   # Calculate elapsed time
   ELAPSED=$(($(date +%s) - $(date -d "$SPAWN_TIME" +%s)))
   
   # Timeout after 30 minutes
   if [ $ELAPSED -gt 1800 ]; then
     echo "‚úó Timeout waiting for merge plan"
     # Transition to ERROR_RECOVERY
   fi
   ```

5. **Update State When Complete**
   ```yaml
   current_state: WAITING_FOR_MERGE_PLAN
   wave_integration:
     merge_plan: wave-X-integration/WAVE-MERGE-PLAN.md
     merge_plan_created: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS
     plan_validation: PASSED
   ```

## Transition Rules

### üî¥üî¥üî¥ CRITICAL: Update State BEFORE Stopping! üî¥üî¥üî¥
Per R322, you MUST update `current_state` to the next state BEFORE stopping:

```bash
# When merge plan is validated and ready to transition:
echo "üìù Updating state file for transition..."
yq -i '.current_state = "SPAWN_INTEGRATION_AGENT"' orchestrator-state.yaml
yq -i '.previous_state = "WAITING_FOR_MERGE_PLAN"' orchestrator-state.yaml
yq -i ".transition_time = \"$(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)\"" orchestrator-state.yaml
yq -i '.wave_integration.merge_plan = "integration-workspace/WAVE-MERGE-PLAN.md"' orchestrator-state.yaml
git add orchestrator-state.yaml
git commit -m "state: transition from WAITING_FOR_MERGE_PLAN to SPAWN_INTEGRATION_AGENT"
git push

# THEN stop per R322
echo "üõë Stopping before SPAWN_INTEGRATION_AGENT state (per R322)"
```

### Valid Next States
- **SPAWN_INTEGRATION_AGENT** - Merge plan created and validated (UPDATE STATE FIRST!)
- **ERROR_RECOVERY** - Timeout or Code Reviewer blocked (UPDATE STATE FIRST!)

### Invalid Transitions
- ‚ùå Skipping to MONITORING_INTEGRATION without spawn
- ‚ùå Going back to spawn states
- ‚ùå Transitioning without merge plan
- ‚ùå Stopping without updating current_state (CAUSES LOOPS!)

## Common Violations to Avoid

1. **Passive waiting** - Violates R233, must actively check
2. **Not checking TodoWrite** - Violates R232 before transition
3. **Missing plan validation** - Proceeding with invalid plan
4. **Ignoring timeouts** - Waiting forever for blocked agent
5. **Not saving progress** - Violates R287 persistence

## Monitoring Pattern

```bash
# CORRECT: Active monitoring with status updates
echo "Checking for merge plan at $(date)"
while [ ! -f wave-*/WAVE-MERGE-PLAN.md ]; do
  echo "Plan not ready, checking again in 30s..."
  # Also check agent status
  test -f wave-*/status.yaml && cat wave-*/status.yaml
  sleep 30
done
echo "‚úì Merge plan created"

# WRONG: Passive waiting
echo "Waiting for Code Reviewer to finish..."
sleep 600  # Just sleeping without checking
```

## Verification Commands

```bash
# Verify state entry
echo "Entered WAITING_FOR_MERGE_PLAN at $(date)"
echo "Starting active monitoring for merge plan"

# Check spawn record
grep "spawned_agents" orchestrator-state.yaml

# Monitor loop
for i in {1..60}; do
  test -f wave-*/WAVE-MERGE-PLAN.md && break
  echo "Check $i: Plan not ready"
  sleep 30
done

# Validate plan when found
if [ -f wave-*/WAVE-MERGE-PLAN.md ]; then
  echo "‚úì Merge plan found"
  wc -l wave-*/WAVE-MERGE-PLAN.md
else
  echo "‚úó Timeout - no merge plan after 30 minutes"
fi
```
