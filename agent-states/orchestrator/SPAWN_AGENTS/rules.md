# Orchestrator - SPAWN_AGENTS State Rules

## üõëüõëüõë R322 MANDATORY STOP BEFORE STATE TRANSITIONS üõëüõëüõë

**SUPREME LAW - VIOLATION = -100% IMMEDIATE FAILURE**

### YOU MUST STOP AFTER:
1. ‚úÖ Completing all TODOs for this state
2. ‚úÖ Updating orchestrator-state.yaml with new state
3. ‚úÖ Committing and pushing the state file  
4. ‚úÖ Providing work summary

### YOU MUST NOT:
- ‚ùå Continue to the next state automatically
- ‚ùå Start work for the new state
- ‚ùå Spawn agents for the new state
- ‚ùå Assume permission to continue

### STOP PROTOCOL:
```markdown
## üõë STATE TRANSITION CHECKPOINT: CURRENT_STATE ‚Üí NEXT_STATE

### ‚úÖ Current State Work Completed:
- [List completed work]

### üìä Current Status:
- Current State: CURRENT_STATE
- Next State: NEXT_STATE
- TODOs Completed: X/Y
- State Files: Updated and committed ‚úÖ

### ‚è∏Ô∏è STOPPED - Awaiting User Continuation
Ready to transition to NEXT_STATE. Please use /continue-orchestrating.
```

**STOP MEANS STOP - Exit and wait for /continue-orchestrating**

---


## üî¥üî¥üî¥ STOP! STATE RULE READING IS ABSOLUTELY FIRST! üî¥üî¥üî¥

**YOU HAVE ENTERED SPAWN_AGENTS STATE - YOU MUST READ AND ACKNOWLEDGE ALL STATE RULES BEFORE DOING ANY STATE WORK!**

## üî¥üî¥üî¥ R290 VERIFICATION REQUIREMENT üî¥üî¥üî¥

**R290 ENFORCEMENT: CREATE VERIFICATION MARKER AFTER READING**

After reading and acknowledging all state rules, you MUST create a verification marker:

```bash
# MANDATORY: Create verification marker after reading rules
touch .state_rules_read_orchestrator_SPAWN_AGENTS
echo "$(date +%s) - Rules read and acknowledged for SPAWN_AGENTS" > .state_rules_read_orchestrator_SPAWN_AGENTS
```

**FAILURE TO CREATE MARKER = AUTOMATIC -100% PENALTY**

The system will check for this marker. No marker = Immediate failure.

### ‚ùå DO NOT DO ANY SPAWN_AGENTS WORK UNTIL RULES ARE READ:
- ‚ùå Start spawn software engineer agents
- ‚ùå Start assign effort work
- ‚ùå Start distribute implementation tasks
- ‚ùå Update state files
- ‚ùå Continue to next state
- ‚ùå Think about what to do in this state

### ‚úÖ YOU MUST IMMEDIATELY:

## üî¥üî¥üî¥ MANDATORY STATE RULE READING AND ACKNOWLEDGMENT üî¥üî¥üî¥

### ‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è YOU MUST READ EACH RULE FILE LISTED IN PRIMARY DIRECTIVES. **I AM WATCHING YOUR TOOL CALLS FOR READ OPERATIONS** *YOU WILL FAIL* IF YOU DO NOT MAKE A READ FILE CALL FOR EACH RULE FILE IN PRIMARY DIRECTIVES!!! ‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è

**AFTER READING, YOU MUST ACKNOWLEDGE ALL THE STATE RULES AND STATE THAT YOU WILL ABIDE BY THEM ONE AT A TIME GIVING THE RULE NUMBER AND DESCRIPTION.**

### ‚ùå ANTI-PATTERNS THAT WILL CAUSE FAILURE:

1. **Fake Acknowledgment Without Reading**:
   ```
   ‚ùå WRONG: "I acknowledge R151, R208, R053..."
   (No Read tool calls detected = AUTOMATIC FAILURE)
   ```

2. **Bulk Acknowledgment**:
   ```
   ‚ùå WRONG: "I acknowledge all SPAWN_AGENTS rules"
   (YOU Must READ AND ACKNOWLEDGE EACH rule individually)
   ```

3. **Silent Reading**:
   ```
   ‚ùå WRONG: [Reads rules but doesn't acknowledge]
   "Now I've read the rules, let me start work..."
   (MUST explicitly acknowledge EACH rule)
   ```

4. **Reading From Memory**:
   ```
   ‚ùå WRONG: "I know R208 requires CD before spawn..."
   (Must READ from file, not recall from memory)
   ```

5. **Skipping Rules in PRIMARY DIRECTIVES**:
   ```
   ‚ùå WRONG: Reading only some rules from the list
   (ALL rules in PRIMARY DIRECTIVES are MANDATORY)
   ```

### ‚úÖ CORRECT PATTERN FOR SPAWN_AGENTS:
```
1. READ: $CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/rule-library/[first-rule-file].md
2. "I acknowledge [Rule#] - [Rule Name]: [Brief description]"
3. READ: $CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/rule-library/[second-rule-file].md  
4. "I acknowledge [Rule#] - [Rule Name]: [Brief description]"
[Continue for EVERY rule in PRIMARY DIRECTIVES...]
5. "Ready to execute SPAWN_AGENTS work"
```

### üö® NO WORK UNTIL ACKNOWLEDGMENT COMPLETE üö®
**You may NOT begin ANY SPAWN_AGENTS work until:**
1. ‚úÖ ALL rules in PRIMARY DIRECTIVES have been READ
2. ‚úÖ ALL rules have been individually ACKNOWLEDGED
3. ‚úÖ You have stated readiness to execute SPAWN_AGENTS work
1. **READ** every rule file listed in PRIMARY DIRECTIVES below
2. **ACKNOWLEDGE** each rule individually with number and description
3. **ONLY THEN** proceed with SPAWN_AGENTS work

### üö® FAILURE TO READ STATE RULES FIRST = IMMEDIATE EXIT üö®
**If you do ANY SPAWN_AGENTS work before reading and acknowledging rules:**
- **STOP ALL WORK IMMEDIATELY**
- **EXIT WITH FAILURE STATUS**
- **YOU HAVE VIOLATED STATE COMPLIANCE**

**THE SYSTEM IS MONITORING YOUR READ TOOL CALLS!**

## üìã PRIMARY DIRECTIVES FOR SPAWN_AGENTS

**YOU MUST READ EACH RULE LISTED HERE. YOUR READ TOOL CALLS ARE BEING MONITORED.**

### State-Specific Rules (NOT in orchestrator.md):

**Note**: R208 (CD before spawn), R221 (bash reset) are already in orchestrator.md Supreme Laws.

## üî¥üî¥üî¥ MANDATORY SPAWN DIRECTORY VERIFICATION PROTOCOL üî¥üî¥üî¥

### R208 ENFORCEMENT: Pre-Spawn Directory Verification
**EVERY AGENT SPAWN MUST FOLLOW THIS EXACT SEQUENCE:**

```bash
# 1. DETERMINE target directory for the agent
TARGET_DIR="/efforts/phase${PHASE}/wave${WAVE}/${EFFORT_NAME}"
echo "üéØ Target directory for agent: $TARGET_DIR"

# 2. VERIFY directory exists (create if needed)
if [ ! -d "$TARGET_DIR" ]; then
    echo "üìÅ Creating target directory: $TARGET_DIR"
    mkdir -p "$TARGET_DIR"
fi

# 3. CD to that directory (R208 MANDATORY - NO EXCEPTIONS)
echo "üîÑ Changing to target directory..."
cd "$TARGET_DIR" || {
    echo "‚ùå‚ùå‚ùå FATAL: Cannot change to $TARGET_DIR"
    echo "‚ùå‚ùå‚ùå R208 VIOLATION: Cannot spawn without CD!"
    exit 208
}

# 4. VERIFY pwd output shows correct directory
ACTUAL_DIR=$(pwd)
echo "‚úÖ Now in: $ACTUAL_DIR"
if [ "$ACTUAL_DIR" != "$TARGET_DIR" ]; then
    echo "‚ùå‚ùå‚ùå FATAL: Directory mismatch!"
    echo "Expected: $TARGET_DIR"
    echo "Actual: $ACTUAL_DIR"
    exit 208
fi

# 5. SPAWN the agent (ONLY after successful CD and verification)
echo "üöÄ Spawning agent from verified directory: $(pwd)"
# [Actual spawn command here]

# 6. RETURN to orchestrator directory
cd "$ORCHESTRATOR_DIR"
echo "üìç Returned to orchestrator directory: $(pwd)"
```

**VIOLATIONS = AUTOMATIC -100% FAILURE:**
- ‚ùå Spawning without CD'ing first
- ‚ùå Skipping pwd verification
- ‚ùå Assuming agent will CD itself
- ‚ùå Using --working-directory flag instead of CD
- ‚ùå Not returning to orchestrator directory after spawn

## üî¥üî¥üî¥ MANDATORY MEASUREMENT RULE - R304 üî¥üî¥üî¥

### R304: Mandatory Line Counter Tool Enforcement
**File**: `$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/rule-library/R304-mandatory-line-counter-enforcement.md`
**Criticality**: BLOCKING - Manual counting = AUTOMATIC -100% FAILURE

**ABSOLUTE REQUIREMENTS:**
- ‚úÖ MUST use `$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/tools/line-counter.sh` for ALL line counting
- ‚ùå NEVER use `wc -l` or any manual counting method
- ‚ùå NEVER count lines any other way - this is a -100% automatic failure
- ‚úÖ MUST specify both -b (base branch) and -c (current branch) parameters
- ‚úÖ Base branch MUST be phase integration branch (NOT "main")

**Failure to use the line counter tool = AUTOMATIC -100% GRADE**

## üö® SPAWN_AGENTS IS A VERB - START SPAWNING AGENTS IMMEDIATELY! üö®

**See R151 for immediate action requirements when entering this state.**

The SPAWN_AGENTS state requires IMMEDIATE spawning action - no pausing or waiting.
See rule R151 which includes requirements for immediate state execution.

## State Context
You are spawning SW Engineers to implement efforts based on the implementation plans created by Code Reviewers.

## üî¥üî¥üî¥ PREREQUISITES FOR SPAWN_AGENTS üî¥üî¥üî¥

**BEFORE ENTERING THIS STATE, YOU MUST ALREADY HAVE:**
1. ‚úÖ All effort directories created (done in SETUP_EFFORT_INFRASTRUCTURE)
2. ‚úÖ All git clones and branches ready (done in SETUP_EFFORT_INFRASTRUCTURE) 
3. ‚úÖ All effort IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN.md files (created by Code Reviewers)
4. ‚úÖ All work-log.md files initialized
5. ‚úÖ **PARALLELIZATION ANALYSIS COMPLETE (ANALYZE_IMPLEMENTATION_PARALLELIZATION)**
6. ‚úÖ **SW Engineer parallelization plan in orchestrator-state.yaml**

**IF PARALLELIZATION NOT ANALYZED, GO BACK TO ANALYZE_IMPLEMENTATION_PARALLELIZATION!**
**Infrastructure was created BEFORE Code Reviewers made plans!**
**Now you're just spawning SW Engineers to implement using the PRE-ANALYZED strategy.**


## Parallel Spawning


## ‚úÖ Infrastructure Already Ready

Infrastructure was set up in SETUP_EFFORT_INFRASTRUCTURE state:
- Effort directories exist at: `efforts/phase{X}/wave{Y}/{effort-name}`
- Git branches created with project prefix from target-repo-config.yaml
- Remote tracking configured
- IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN.md files created by Code Reviewers
- work-log.md files initialized
- **SW Engineer parallelization plan in orchestrator-state.yaml**

**Just CD to directories and spawn SW Engineers per the analyzed plan!**

### R287 TODO PERSISTENCE + R322 MANDATORY STOP
```bash
# After all SW Engineers spawned
echo "üíæ R287: Saving TODOs after spawning SW Engineers..."
save_todos "SPAWN_AGENTS complete - all SW Engineers spawned"

# R287: Commit within 60 seconds
cd $CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR
git add todos/*.todo orchestrator-state.yaml
git commit -m "todo: SW Engineers spawned, stopping per R322"
git push

# üî¥üî¥üî¥ R322 MANDATORY STOP AFTER SPAWNING üî¥üî¥üî¥

- PHASE: {phase_number}
- YOUR TASK: Implement features as specified in IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN.md

üî¥üî¥üî¥ CRITICAL: YOU WILL NOT BE IN THE RIGHT DIRECTORY! üî¥üî¥üî¥
YOU MUST NAVIGATE TO YOUR EFFORT DIRECTORY IMMEDIATELY!

TARGET_DIRECTORY: /efforts/phase{X}/wave{Y}/{effort-name}
EXPECTED_BRANCH: {PROJECT_PREFIX}/phase{X}/wave{Y}/{effort-name}

2. Navigate to effort directory: cd /efforts/phase{X}/wave{Y}/{effort-name}
3. Verify you're now in correct directory: pwd
4. Verify branch: git branch --show-current
5. If directory doesn't exist or branch is wrong:
   - STOP IMMEDIATELY
   - Report: "‚ùå ENVIRONMENT ERROR: Directory or branch incorrect"
   - Request orchestrator correction
6. Run R209 directory isolation protocol
7. Set readonly EFFORT_ISOLATION_DIR environment variable

BRANCH: {PROJECT_PREFIX}/phase{X}/wave{Y}/effort{Z}-{name}  # Include project prefix from target-repo-config.yaml!

REQUIREMENTS:
- Follow IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN.md exactly (R295: This is your ONLY plan)
- Size limit: {limit} lines
- Test coverage: {X}% minimum
- Update work-log.md every checkpoint

- Work log updated
- Code committed and pushed
```

## Parallelization Matrix

**See R053-parallelization-decisions.md in rule-library for parallelization decisions guidance.**

Key points:
- Can parallelize: Independent efforts, no shared dependencies
- Must serialize: Dependent efforts, splits, shared files

## Recording Spawn Times

```yaml
# Update in orchestrator-state.yaml
parallel_spawn_records:
  wave{X}_group{Y}:
    spawned_at: "2025-08-23T14:30:45Z"
    agents:
      - name: "sw-engineer-effort1"
        timestamp: "2025-08-23T14:30:47Z"
      - name: "sw-engineer-effort2"
        timestamp: "2025-08-23T14:30:49Z"
      - name: "sw-engineer-effort3"
        timestamp: "2025-08-23T14:30:51Z"
    deltas: [2, 2]
    average_delta: 2.0
    grade: "PASS"
```

## Common Spawn Patterns

### Pattern 1: Wave Start (All Planning)
```
Spawn all Code Reviewers for planning ‚Üí Wait ‚Üí Spawn all SW Engineers
```

### Pattern 2: Post-Implementation (All Reviews)
```
Spawn all Code Reviewers for review ‚Üí Process decisions ‚Üí Handle splits/fixes
```

### Pattern 3: Mixed Dependencies
```
Spawn independent efforts ‚Üí Monitor ‚Üí Spawn dependent efforts as prerequisites complete
```

## Grading Calculation

```python
def calculate_spawn_grade(timestamps):
    if len(timestamps) < 2:
        return "PASS"  # Single spawn
    
    deltas = []
    for i in range(1, len(timestamps)):
        delta = (timestamps[i] - timestamps[i-1]).total_seconds()
        deltas.append(delta)
    
    avg = sum(deltas) / len(deltas)
    grade = "PASS" if avg < 5.0 else "FAIL"
    
    print(f"Spawn Grade: {grade}")
    print(f"Average Delta: {avg:.2f}s (target: <5s)")
    
    return grade
```


## R322 VIOLATION DETECTION

If you find yourself:
- Starting work for a new state without /continue-orchestrating
- Transitioning without stopping after state file commit
- Continuing after completing state work

**STOP IMMEDIATELY - You are violating R322!**
