# Orchestrator - SETUP_EFFORT_INFRASTRUCTURE State Rules

## üõëüõëüõë R322 MANDATORY STOP BEFORE STATE TRANSITIONS üõëüõëüõë

**SUPREME LAW - VIOLATION = -100% IMMEDIATE FAILURE**

### YOU MUST STOP AFTER:
1. ‚úÖ Completing all TODOs for this state
2. ‚úÖ Updating orchestrator-state.yaml with new state
3. ‚úÖ Committing and pushing the state file  
4. ‚úÖ Providing work summary

### YOU MUST NOT:
- ‚ùå Continue to the next state automatically
- ‚ùå Start work for the new state
- ‚ùå Spawn agents for the new state
- ‚ùå Assume permission to continue

### STOP PROTOCOL:
```markdown
## üõë STATE TRANSITION CHECKPOINT: CURRENT_STATE ‚Üí NEXT_STATE

### ‚úÖ Current State Work Completed:
- [List completed work]

### üìä Current Status:
- Current State: CURRENT_STATE
- Next State: NEXT_STATE
- TODOs Completed: X/Y
- State Files: Updated and committed ‚úÖ

### ‚è∏Ô∏è STOPPED - Awaiting User Continuation
Ready to transition to NEXT_STATE. Please use /continue-orchestrating.
```

**STOP MEANS STOP - Exit and wait for /continue-orchestrating**

## üî¥üî¥üî¥ CRITICAL: BASE BRANCH DETERMINATION (R308) üî¥üî¥üî¥

**VIOLATION = -100% AUTOMATIC FAILURE**

### YOU MUST DETERMINE THE CORRECT BASE BRANCH PER R308:
- Phase 1, Wave 1: from **main**
- Phase 1, Wave 2+: from **phase1-wave[N-1]-integration**  
- Phase 2+, Wave 1: from **phase[N-1]-integration** (NEVER main!)
- Phase 2+, Wave 2+: from **phase[N]-wave[N-1]-integration**

### NEVER BASE PHASE 2 ON MAIN!

Example for Phase 2, Wave 1:
```bash
# WRONG - AUTOMATIC FAILURE:
BASE_BRANCH="main"  # ‚ùå NEVER!

# CORRECT:
BASE_BRANCH="phase1-integration"  # ‚úÖ From previous phase!
```

**Acknowledge: "I understand Phase 2 efforts MUST be based on phase1-integration per R308"**

## üî¥üî¥üî¥ STOP! STATE RULE READING IS ABSOLUTELY FIRST! üî¥üî¥üî¥

**YOU HAVE ENTERED SETUP_EFFORT_INFRASTRUCTURE STATE - YOU MUST READ AND ACKNOWLEDGE ALL STATE RULES BEFORE DOING ANY STATE WORK!**

## üî¥üî¥üî¥ R290 VERIFICATION REQUIREMENT üî¥üî¥üî¥

**R290 ENFORCEMENT: CREATE VERIFICATION MARKER AFTER READING**

After reading and acknowledging all state rules, you MUST create a verification marker:

```bash
# MANDATORY: Create verification marker after reading rules
touch .state_rules_read_orchestrator_SETUP_EFFORT_INFRASTRUCTURE
echo "$(date +%s) - Rules read and acknowledged for SETUP_EFFORT_INFRASTRUCTURE" > .state_rules_read_orchestrator_SETUP_EFFORT_INFRASTRUCTURE
```

**FAILURE TO CREATE MARKER = AUTOMATIC -100% PENALTY**

The system will check for this marker. No marker = Immediate failure.

### ‚ùå DO NOT DO ANY SETUP_EFFORT_INFRASTRUCTURE WORK UNTIL RULES ARE READ:
- ‚ùå Start create effort directories
- ‚ùå Start set up branches
- ‚ùå Start initialize effort tracking
- ‚ùå Start configure worktrees
- ‚ùå Update state files
- ‚ùå Continue to next state
- ‚ùå Think about what to do in this state

### ‚úÖ YOU MUST IMMEDIATELY:

## üî¥üî¥üî¥ MANDATORY STATE RULE READING AND ACKNOWLEDGMENT üî¥üî¥üî¥

### ‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è YOU MUST READ EACH RULE FILE LISTED IN PRIMARY DIRECTIVES. **I AM WATCHING YOUR TOOL CALLS FOR READ OPERATIONS** *YOU WILL FAIL* IF YOU DO NOT MAKE A READ FILE CALL FOR EACH RULE FILE IN PRIMARY DIRECTIVES!!! ‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è

**AFTER READING, YOU MUST ACKNOWLEDGE ALL THE STATE RULES AND STATE THAT YOU WILL ABIDE BY THEM ONE AT A TIME GIVING THE RULE NUMBER AND DESCRIPTION.**

### ‚ùå ANTI-PATTERNS THAT WILL CAUSE FAILURE:

1. **Fake Acknowledgment Without Reading**:
   ```
   ‚ùå WRONG: "I acknowledge R151, R208, R053..."
   (No Read tool calls detected = AUTOMATIC FAILURE)
   ```

2. **Bulk Acknowledgment**:
   ```
   ‚ùå WRONG: "I acknowledge all SETUP_EFFORT_INFRASTRUCTURE rules"
   (YOU Must READ AND ACKNOWLEDGE EACH rule individually)
   ```

3. **Silent Reading**:
   ```
   ‚ùå WRONG: [Reads rules but doesn't acknowledge]
   "Now I've read the rules, let me start work..."
   (MUST explicitly acknowledge EACH rule)
   ```

4. **Reading From Memory**:
   ```
   ‚ùå WRONG: "I know R208 requires CD before spawn..."
   (Must READ from file, not recall from memory)
   ```

5. **Skipping Rules in PRIMARY DIRECTIVES**:
   ```
   ‚ùå WRONG: Reading only some rules from the list
   (ALL rules in PRIMARY DIRECTIVES are MANDATORY)
   ```

### ‚úÖ CORRECT PATTERN FOR SETUP_EFFORT_INFRASTRUCTURE:
```
1. READ: $CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/rule-library/[first-rule-file].md
2. "I acknowledge [Rule#] - [Rule Name]: [Brief description]"
3. READ: $CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/rule-library/[second-rule-file].md  
4. "I acknowledge [Rule#] - [Rule Name]: [Brief description]"
[Continue for EVERY rule in PRIMARY DIRECTIVES...]
5. "Ready to execute SETUP_EFFORT_INFRASTRUCTURE work"
```

### üö® NO WORK UNTIL ACKNOWLEDGMENT COMPLETE üö®
**You may NOT begin ANY SETUP_EFFORT_INFRASTRUCTURE work until:**
1. ‚úÖ ALL rules in PRIMARY DIRECTIVES have been READ
2. ‚úÖ ALL rules have been individually ACKNOWLEDGED
3. ‚úÖ You have stated readiness to execute SETUP_EFFORT_INFRASTRUCTURE work
1. **READ** every rule file listed in PRIMARY DIRECTIVES below
2. **ACKNOWLEDGE** each rule individually with number and description
3. **ONLY THEN** proceed with SETUP_EFFORT_INFRASTRUCTURE work

### üö® FAILURE TO READ STATE RULES FIRST = IMMEDIATE EXIT üö®
**If you do ANY SETUP_EFFORT_INFRASTRUCTURE work before reading and acknowledging rules:**
- **STOP ALL WORK IMMEDIATELY**
- **EXIT WITH FAILURE STATUS**
- **YOU HAVE VIOLATED STATE COMPLIANCE**

**THE SYSTEM IS MONITORING YOUR READ TOOL CALLS!**

## üî¥üî¥üî¥ CRITICAL: NEVER CREATE BRANCHES IN SF REPO! üî¥üî¥üî¥

**BEFORE READING ANY RULES, UNDERSTAND THIS FUNDAMENTAL TRUTH:**

### ‚ùå‚ùå‚ùå EFFORT BRANCHES GO IN TARGET REPOSITORY CLONES, NOT HERE! ‚ùå‚ùå‚ùå

**THIS IS THE SOFTWARE FACTORY REPO (PLANNING/ORCHESTRATION)**
- Path: `/home/vscode/software-factory-template/`
- Purpose: Rules, agents, state management ONLY
- **NEVER CREATE EFFORT BRANCHES HERE!**

**TARGET REPOSITORY IS COMPLETELY DIFFERENT**
- Defined in: `target-repo-config.yaml`
- Gets cloned to: `efforts/phaseX/waveY/effort-name/`
- **THIS IS WHERE ALL EFFORT BRANCHES GO!**

**VIOLATION = -100% AUTOMATIC FAILURE**

## üìã PRIMARY DIRECTIVES FOR SETUP_EFFORT_INFRASTRUCTURE

**YOU MUST READ EACH RULE LISTED HERE. YOUR READ TOOL CALLS ARE BEING MONITORED.**

## üî¥üî¥üî¥ MANDATORY MEASUREMENT RULE - R304 üî¥üî¥üî¥

### R304: Mandatory Line Counter Tool Enforcement
**File**: `$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/rule-library/R304-mandatory-line-counter-enforcement.md`
**Criticality**: BLOCKING - Manual counting = AUTOMATIC -100% FAILURE

**ABSOLUTE REQUIREMENTS:**
- ‚úÖ MUST use `$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/tools/line-counter.sh` for ALL line counting
- ‚ùå NEVER use `wc -l` or any manual counting method
- ‚ùå NEVER count lines any other way - this is a -100% automatic failure
- ‚úÖ MUST specify both -b (base branch) and -c (current branch) parameters
- ‚úÖ Base branch MUST be phase integration branch (NOT "main")

**Failure to use the line counter tool = AUTOMATIC -100% GRADE**

### State-Specific Rules (NOT in orchestrator.md):

1. **üö®üö®üö® R006** - ORCHESTRATOR NEVER WRITES CODE OR PERFORMS FILE OPERATIONS (BLOCKING)
   - File: `$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/rule-library/R006-orchestrator-never-writes-code.md`
   - Criticality: BLOCKING - Automatic termination, 0% grade
   - Summary: NEVER write, copy, move, or manipulate ANY code files - delegate ALL to agents
   - **CRITICAL**: Creating directories is OK, copying/moving files is FORBIDDEN!

2. **üö®üö®üö® R315** - Infrastructure vs Implementation Boundary (BLOCKING)
   - File: `$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/rule-library/R315-infrastructure-vs-implementation-boundary.md`
   - Criticality: BLOCKING - -50% for violations
   - Summary: Create ONLY empty infrastructure, NEVER copy/move code files
   - **CRITICAL**: Empty directories = infrastructure, File operations = implementation!

3. **R308** - INCREMENTAL BRANCHING STRATEGY (SUPREME LAW!)
   - File: `$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/rule-library/R308-incremental-branching-strategy.md`
   - Criticality: üî¥üî¥üî¥ SUPREME LAW - Phase 2 NEVER from main!
   - **READ THIS FIRST - DETERMINES ALL BASE BRANCHES!**
   - **PHASE 2 FROM PHASE1-INTEGRATION, NOT MAIN!**

4. **R309** - NEVER Create Efforts in SF Repo (PARAMOUNT LAW!)
   - File: `$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/rule-library/R309-never-create-efforts-in-sf-repo.md`
   - Criticality: PARAMOUNT - Automatic -100% failure for violation
   - **AVOID CATASTROPHIC FAILURE!**

5. **R312** - Git Config Immutability Protocol (SUPREME LAW!)
   - File: `$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/rule-library/R312-git-config-immutability-protocol.md`
   - Criticality: üî¥üî¥üî¥ SUPREME LAW - Lock .git/config after setup
   - **CRITICAL FOR EFFORT ISOLATION!**
   - **PREVENTS BRANCH/REMOTE CONTAMINATION!**

6. **R191** - Target Repository Configuration
   - File: `$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/rule-library/R191-target-repo-config.md`
   - Criticality: BLOCKING - Must load config before proceeding
   
7. **R176** - Workspace Isolation  
   - File: `$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/rule-library/R176-workspace-isolation.md`
   - Criticality: BLOCKING - Ensure complete workspace isolation

8. **R271** - Single-Branch Full Checkout Protocol
   - File: `$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/rule-library/R271-single-branch-full-checkout.md`
   - Criticality: SUPREME LAW - Full single-branch checkout required

**Note**: R234, R208, R221, R287, R288 are already in your orchestrator.md Supreme Laws section.

## üìã RULE SUMMARY FOR SETUP_EFFORT_INFRASTRUCTURE STATE

### Rules Enforced in This State:
- R308: INCREMENTAL BRANCHING [üî¥ SUPREME LAW - PHASE 2 FROM PHASE1-INTEGRATION!]
- R309: NEVER Create Efforts in SF Repo [PARAMOUNT LAW - -100% FOR VIOLATION!]
- R234: Mandatory State Traversal [SUPREME LAW - NO SKIPPING!]
- R208: CD Before Spawn [SUPREME LAW - Always CD first]
- R221: Bash Directory Reset [SUPREME LAW - CD in every command]

### Critical Requirements:
1. **DETERMINE CORRECT BASE BRANCH PER R308** - Penalty: -100%
   - Phase 2, Wave 1 MUST use phase1-integration (NOT main!)
   - Phase 2, Wave 2+ MUST use phase2-wave[N-1]-integration
2. Load target-repo-config.yaml - Penalty: -100%
3. Create ALL effort directories - Penalty: -50%
4. Clone FULL repos (no sparse) - Penalty: -100%
5. Clone from CORRECT incremental base - Penalty: -100%
6. Push all branches to remote - Penalty: -30%
7. Must transition to ANALYZE_CODE_REVIEWER_PARALLELIZATION - Penalty: -100%

### Success Criteria:
- ‚úÖ Target config loaded and validated
- ‚úÖ All effort directories created under /efforts/
- ‚úÖ All repos are FULL clones (R271)
- ‚úÖ All branches pushed with tracking
- ‚úÖ work-log.md files initialized

### Failure Triggers:
- ‚ùå Skip to SPAWN_AGENTS = -100% R234 VIOLATION
- ‚ùå Clone wrong repository = AUTOMATIC FAILURE
- ‚ùå Sparse checkout detected = R271 VIOLATION
- ‚ùå Missing target-repo-config.yaml = Cannot proceed

## üö® SETUP_EFFORT_INFRASTRUCTURE IS A VERB - CREATE INFRASTRUCTURE NOW! üö®

### IMMEDIATE ACTIONS UPON ENTERING SETUP_EFFORT_INFRASTRUCTURE

**THE MOMENT YOU ENTER THIS STATE, YOU MUST:**
1. Start creating effort directories NOW using prepare_effort_for_agent()
2. Initialize Git branches for each effort immediately
3. Set up remote tracking for all branches without delay
4. Check TodoWrite for pending infrastructure tasks
5. Create standard subdirectories (src/, tests/, docs/) immediately

**FORBIDDEN - AUTOMATIC FAILURE:**
- ‚ùå "STATE TRANSITION COMPLETE: Now in SETUP_EFFORT_INFRASTRUCTURE" [stops]
- ‚ùå "Successfully entered SETUP_EFFORT_INFRASTRUCTURE state" [waits]
- ‚ùå "Ready to set up infrastructure" [pauses]
- ‚ùå "I'm in infrastructure setup state" [does nothing]

**REQUIRED - IMMEDIATE ACTION:**
- ‚úÖ "Entering SETUP_EFFORT_INFRASTRUCTURE, creating E3.1.1 directory now..."
- ‚úÖ "Setting up infrastructure, cloning repo for E3.1.1..."
- ‚úÖ "SETUP_EFFORT_INFRASTRUCTURE: Creating branch for E3.1.1..."

## State Context
You are setting up infrastructure for all efforts in the wave BEFORE spawning code reviewers to create effort plans - DO IT NOW!

## üî¥üî¥üî¥ SUPREME LAW R234 - MANDATORY STATE TRAVERSAL üî¥üî¥üî¥

**THIS IS THE HIGHEST LAW - SUPERSEDES ALL OTHER RULES!**

### MANDATORY NEXT STATE: ANALYZE_CODE_REVIEWER_PARALLELIZATION

**YOU MUST FOLLOW THIS EXACT SEQUENCE:**
```
SETUP_EFFORT_INFRASTRUCTURE (YOU ARE HERE)
    ‚Üì (CANNOT SKIP - MANDATORY)
ANALYZE_CODE_REVIEWER_PARALLELIZATION
    ‚Üì (CANNOT SKIP - MANDATORY)
SPAWN_CODE_REVIEWERS_EFFORT_PLANNING
    ‚Üì (CANNOT SKIP - MANDATORY)
WAITING_FOR_EFFORT_PLANS
    ‚Üì (CANNOT SKIP - MANDATORY)
ANALYZE_IMPLEMENTATION_PARALLELIZATION
    ‚Üì (CANNOT SKIP - MANDATORY)
SPAWN_AGENTS
```

**‚ùå‚ùå‚ùå FORBIDDEN TRANSITIONS (AUTOMATIC -100% FAILURE):**
- ‚ùå SETUP_EFFORT_INFRASTRUCTURE ‚Üí SPAWN_AGENTS (skipping analysis)
- ‚ùå SETUP_EFFORT_INFRASTRUCTURE ‚Üí SPAWN_CODE_REVIEWERS_EFFORT_PLANNING (skipping analysis)
- ‚ùå ANY attempt to "optimize" by skipping states

**ACKNOWLEDGMENT REQUIRED:**
"I acknowledge R234: I MUST transition to ANALYZE_CODE_REVIEWER_PARALLELIZATION next, not skip ahead."

## üî¥üî¥üî¥ CRITICAL: LOAD TARGET CONFIG FIRST (R191) üî¥üî¥üî¥

### BEFORE ANY INFRASTRUCTURE SETUP, YOU MUST:
```bash
# MANDATORY FIRST ACTION IN THIS STATE
echo "üî¥ R191: Loading target repository configuration..."

# Check if already loaded
if [ -z "$TARGET_REPO_URL" ]; then
    echo "‚ö†Ô∏è Target config not loaded, loading now..."
    
    if [ ! -f "$SF_ROOT/target-repo-config.yaml" ]; then
        echo "üî¥üî¥üî¥ CRITICAL: target-repo-config.yaml NOT FOUND!"
        echo "Cannot set up infrastructure without knowing WHAT to clone!"
        exit 191
    fi
    
    # Load and validate config
    TARGET_REPO_URL=$(yq '.target_repository.url' "$SF_ROOT/target-repo-config.yaml")
    BASE_BRANCH=$(yq '.target_repository.base_branch' "$SF_ROOT/target-repo-config.yaml")
    PROJECT_PREFIX=$(yq '.branch_naming.project_prefix' "$SF_ROOT/target-repo-config.yaml")
    
    if [ -z "$TARGET_REPO_URL" ] || [ "$TARGET_REPO_URL" = "null" ]; then
        echo "üî¥ ERROR: No target repository URL in config!"
        exit 191
    fi
    
    export TARGET_REPO_URL
    export BASE_BRANCH
    export PROJECT_PREFIX
fi

echo "‚úÖ Target repository: $TARGET_REPO_URL"
echo "‚úÖ This is what will be CLONED into efforts/"
echo "‚ö†Ô∏è NEVER create code in the Software Factory repo itself!"
```

### UNDERSTAND THE TWO REPOSITORIES:
1. **Software Factory Repo** = Where you are now (rules, agents, state)
2. **Target Repo** = What you clone from config (actual project code)

**VIOLATIONS THAT CAUSE FAILURE:**
- Cloning the SF repo into efforts/ = WRONG REPO
- Creating code in SF repo = WRONG LOCATION
- Not having target-repo-config.yaml = CANNOT PROCEED

## üî¥üî¥üî¥ MANDATORY: Infrastructure BEFORE Planning üî¥üî¥üî¥

**THIS IS THE CORRECT SEQUENCE:**
1. Architect creates Wave Architecture Plan
2. Code Reviewer creates Wave Implementation Plan
3. **Orchestrator sets up ALL effort infrastructure** ‚Üê YOU ARE HERE
4. Code Reviewers create individual Effort Implementation Plans
5. SW Engineers implement

## üî¥üî¥üî¥ CRITICAL EXAMPLES: R308 BASE BRANCH DETERMINATION üî¥üî¥üî¥

### Example 1: Phase 2, Wave 1 Infrastructure (MOST COMMON MISTAKE!)
```bash
# ‚ùå‚ùå‚ùå WRONG - AUTOMATIC -100% FAILURE:
PHASE=2 WAVE=1
BASE_BRANCH="main"  # NEVER DO THIS FOR PHASE 2!

# ‚úÖ‚úÖ‚úÖ CORRECT - MUST USE PHASE 1 INTEGRATION:
PHASE=2 WAVE=1
BASE_BRANCH=$(determine_incremental_base_branch 2 1)  # Returns: phase1-integration
echo "Phase 2 Wave 1 MUST use: $BASE_BRANCH (NOT main!)"
```

### Example 2: Phase 2, Wave 2 Infrastructure
```bash
PHASE=2 WAVE=2
BASE_BRANCH=$(determine_incremental_base_branch 2 2)  # Returns: phase2-wave1-integration
echo "Phase 2 Wave 2 uses: $BASE_BRANCH"
```

### Example 3: Phase 3, Wave 1 Infrastructure
```bash
PHASE=3 WAVE=1
BASE_BRANCH=$(determine_incremental_base_branch 3 1)  # Returns: phase2-integration
echo "Phase 3 Wave 1 uses: $BASE_BRANCH (from previous PHASE)"
```

## Example: Setting Up Wave Infrastructure

```bash
# Read current phase/wave from state
PHASE=$(yq '.current_phase' orchestrator-state.yaml)
WAVE=$(yq '.current_wave' orchestrator-state.yaml)

# üî¥ CRITICAL: Check if this is Phase 2!
if [[ $PHASE -eq 2 && $WAVE -eq 1 ]]; then
    echo "üî¥üî¥üî¥ ATTENTION: Phase 2, Wave 1 detected!"
    echo "MUST use phase1-integration as base (R308)"
fi

# Read wave plan to get effort list
WAVE_PLAN="phase-plans/PHASE-${PHASE}-WAVE-${WAVE}-IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN.md"
EFFORTS=$(grep "^## Effort" "$WAVE_PLAN" | sed 's/## Effort [0-9]*: //')

# Setup infrastructure for ALL efforts
for effort in $EFFORTS; do
    prepare_effort_for_agent $PHASE $WAVE "$effort"
done

echo "‚úÖ All effort infrastructure ready with R308 compliant bases"
echo "üìã Ready to spawn Code Reviewers for effort planning"
```

## State Transition

After ALL infrastructure is ready:
1. Update orchestrator-state.yaml with effort directories
2. Verify all branches pushed to remote
3. **MANDATORY: Transition to ANALYZE_CODE_REVIEWER_PARALLELIZATION (R234)**
   - DO NOT skip to SPAWN_CODE_REVIEWERS_EFFORT_PLANNING
   - DO NOT skip to SPAWN_AGENTS
   - MUST follow the mandatory sequence!

### TODO PERSISTENCE CHECKPOINT (R287-R287)
```bash
# Before state transition - MANDATORY SAVE
echo "üíæ R287: Saving TODOs before state transition..."
save_todos "SETUP_EFFORT_INFRASTRUCTURE complete"

# R287: Commit within 60 seconds
cd $CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR
git add todos/*.todo
git commit -m "todo: orchestrator - infrastructure setup complete"
git push
echo "‚úÖ TODOs persisted before transition"
```

## üö®üö®üö® R209 - EFFORT DIRECTORY ISOLATION PROTOCOL (MISSION CRITICAL!)
**Source:** rule-library/R209-effort-directory-isolation-protocol.md  
**Criticality:** MISSION CRITICAL - SW Engineers MUST stay in effort directories  

### MUST INJECT METADATA AND PUSH TO REMOTE!

After Code Reviewer creates IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN.md, YOU MUST ADD DIRECTORY/BRANCH METADATA AND PUSH:

```bash
# üö® MANDATORY: Call this AFTER Code Reviewer creates plan, BEFORE spawning SW Engineer! üö®
inject_r209_metadata() {
    local EFFORT_NAME="$1"
    local PHASE="$2"
    local WAVE="$3"
    local IMPL_PLAN="efforts/phase${PHASE}/wave${WAVE}/${EFFORT_NAME}/IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN.md"
    
    echo "üîß [R209] Injecting metadata for effort: $EFFORT_NAME"
    
    # Check if plan exists
    if [ ! -f "$IMPL_PLAN" ]; then
        echo "‚ö†Ô∏è ERROR: Implementation plan not found at: $IMPL_PLAN"
        return 1
    fi
    
    # Source branch naming helpers
    source utilities/branch-naming-helpers.sh
    
    # Get properly formatted branch name with project prefix
    EFFORT_BRANCH=$(get_effort_branch_name "$PHASE" "$WAVE" "$EFFORT_NAME")
    
    # Add metadata header
    cat > /tmp/r209_metadata.md << EOF
<!-- ‚ö†Ô∏è EFFORT INFRASTRUCTURE METADATA (R209) ‚ö†Ô∏è -->
**EFFORT_NAME**: ${EFFORT_NAME}
**PHASE**: ${PHASE}
**WAVE**: ${WAVE}
**WORKING_DIRECTORY**: $(pwd)/efforts/phase${PHASE}/wave${WAVE}/${EFFORT_NAME}
**BRANCH**: ${EFFORT_BRANCH}
**REMOTE**: origin/${EFFORT_BRANCH}
**ISOLATION_BOUNDARY**: efforts/phase${PHASE}/wave${WAVE}/${EFFORT_NAME}

‚ö†Ô∏è **SW ENGINEER: YOU MUST STAY IN THIS DIRECTORY!** ‚ö†Ô∏è
ALL work happens in: efforts/phase${PHASE}/wave${WAVE}/${EFFORT_NAME}
ALL code goes in: efforts/phase${PHASE}/wave${WAVE}/${EFFORT_NAME}/pkg/
NEVER leave this directory during implementation!
<!-- END METADATA -->

EOF
    
    # Prepend to plan
    cat /tmp/r209_metadata.md "$IMPL_PLAN" > /tmp/updated_plan.md
    mv /tmp/updated_plan.md "$IMPL_PLAN"
    echo "‚úÖ R209: Metadata injected"
    
    # üî¥ CRITICAL: Push to remote!
    ORCH_DIR=$(pwd)
    cd "efforts/phase${PHASE}/wave${WAVE}/${EFFORT_NAME}"
    
    git add IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN.md
    git commit -m "feat: inject R209 metadata into implementation plan"
    
    if git push; then
        echo "‚úÖ Plan with R209 metadata pushed to remote"
    else
        git push -u origin "$(git branch --show-current)"
    fi
    
    cd "$ORCH_DIR"
}
```

### MANDATORY WORKFLOW:
1. Code Reviewer creates IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN.md
2. **WAIT FOR COMPLETION**
3. **INJECT R209 METADATA** (orchestrator does this)
4. **PUSH TO REMOTE**
5. Then spawn SW Engineer

**Note:** This metadata injection typically happens in WAITING_FOR_EFFORT_PLANS state, but the infrastructure must be ready in SETUP_EFFORT_INFRASTRUCTURE.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

‚ùå **WRONG:** Spawning Code Reviewers before creating directories
‚ùå **WRONG:** Forgetting project prefix in branch names
‚ùå **WRONG:** Not pushing branches to remote
‚ùå **WRONG:** Creating infrastructure one-by-one as needed
‚ùå **WRONG:** Not injecting R209 metadata before spawning SW Engineers

‚úÖ **CORRECT:** Create ALL infrastructure first, inject metadata, then spawn agents

## R322 VIOLATION DETECTION

If you find yourself:
- Starting work for a new state without /continue-orchestrating
- Transitioning without stopping after state file commit
- Continuing after completing state work

**STOP IMMEDIATELY - You are violating R322!**
