# Orchestrator - SPAWN_CODE_REVIEWER_MERGE_PLAN State Rules

## State Definition
The orchestrator spawns a Code Reviewer agent to create a merge plan for wave integration. The orchestrator has already set up the integration infrastructure (directory and branch).

## Required Actions

### 1. Verify Integration Infrastructure
```bash
# Confirm integration workspace is ready
PHASE=$(yq '.current_phase' orchestrator-state.yaml)
WAVE=$(yq '.current_wave' orchestrator-state.yaml)
INTEGRATION_DIR="/efforts/phase${PHASE}/wave${WAVE}/integration-workspace"

if [ ! -d "$INTEGRATION_DIR" ]; then
    echo "❌ Integration directory not found!"
    exit 1
fi

# Verify integration branch exists
cd "$INTEGRATION_DIR"
CURRENT_BRANCH=$(git branch --show-current)
if [[ ! "$CURRENT_BRANCH" =~ integration ]]; then
    echo "❌ Integration branch not created!"
    exit 1
fi

echo "✅ Integration infrastructure verified"
echo "📁 Integration directory: $INTEGRATION_DIR"
echo "🌿 Integration branch: $CURRENT_BRANCH"
```

### 2. Spawn Code Reviewer for Merge Plan
```bash
# Prepare spawn command for Code Reviewer
cat > /tmp/code-reviewer-merge-plan-task.md << EOF
Create WAVE MERGE PLAN for Phase ${PHASE} Wave ${WAVE} integration.

CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS (R269, R270):
1. Use ONLY original effort branches - NO integration branches!
2. Analyze branch bases to determine correct merge order
3. Exclude 'too-large' branches, include only splits
4. Create WAVE-MERGE-PLAN.md with exact merge instructions
5. DO NOT execute merges - only plan them!
6. Document expected conflicts and resolution strategies

Integration Directory: ${INTEGRATION_DIR}
Target Branch: ${CURRENT_BRANCH}

You are spawned into state: WAVE_MERGE_PLANNING
EOF

# Spawn Code Reviewer
echo "🚀 Spawning Code Reviewer for merge plan creation..."
/spawn code-reviewer WAVE_MERGE_PLANNING "$(cat /tmp/code-reviewer-merge-plan-task.md)"
```

### 3. Update State Tracking
```yaml
# Update orchestrator-state.yaml
integration_status:
  phase: ${PHASE}
  wave: ${WAVE}
  infrastructure_ready: true
  integration_branch: "${CURRENT_BRANCH}"
  integration_dir: "${INTEGRATION_DIR}"
  merge_plan_requested: true
  merge_plan_ready: false
  waiting_for: "code-reviewer-merge-plan"
```

## Transition Rules
- Immediate transition to: WAITING_FOR_MERGE_PLAN
- Cannot skip to: SPAWN_INTEGRATION_AGENT (must wait for plan)
- Must verify infrastructure before spawning

## Success Criteria
- Integration infrastructure verified
- Code Reviewer spawned with correct state
- Clear instructions provided including R269 and R270
- State tracking updated

### ⚠️⚠️⚠️ RULE R269 - Code Reviewer Merge Plan No Execution
**Source:** rule-library/R269-code-reviewer-merge-plan-no-execution.md
**Criticality:** WARNING

Remind Code Reviewer: Create plan ONLY, no execution!

---
### 🔴🔴🔴 RULE R270 - No Integration Branches as Sources
**Source:** rule-library/R270-no-integration-branches-as-sources.md
**Criticality:** SUPREME

Remind Code Reviewer: Use only original effort branches, never integration branches!
