## üî¥üî¥üî¥ R322 MANDATORY: STOP BEFORE STATE TRANSITIONS üî¥üî¥üî¥

**CRITICAL REQUIREMENT PER R322:**
After spawning ANY agents in this state, you MUST:
1. Record what was spawned in state file
2. Save TODOs per R287
3. Commit and push state changes
4. Display stop message with continuation instructions
5. EXIT immediately with code 0

**VIOLATION = AUTOMATIC -100% FAILURE**

# Orchestrator - SPAWN_ENGINEERS_FOR_FIXES State Rules

## üî¥üî¥üî¥ R290 ENFORCEMENT: READ THESE RULES FIRST! üî¥üî¥üî¥

**SUPREME LAW #3 (R290): STATE RULES MUST BE READ BEFORE STATE ACTIONS**

## üî¥üî¥üî¥ STOP! STATE RULE READING IS ABSOLUTELY FIRST! üî¥üî¥üî¥

**YOU HAVE ENTERED SPAWN_ENGINEERS_FOR_FIXES STATE - YOU MUST READ AND ACKNOWLEDGE ALL STATE RULES BEFORE DOING ANY STATE WORK!**

## üî¥üî¥üî¥ R290 VERIFICATION REQUIREMENT üî¥üî¥üî¥

**R290 ENFORCEMENT: CREATE VERIFICATION MARKER AFTER READING**

After reading and acknowledging all state rules, you MUST create a verification marker:

```bash
# MANDATORY: Create verification marker after reading rules
touch .state_rules_read_orchestrator_SPAWN_ENGINEERS_FOR_FIXES
echo "$(date +%s) - Rules read and acknowledged for SPAWN_ENGINEERS_FOR_FIXES" > .state_rules_read_orchestrator_SPAWN_ENGINEERS_FOR_FIXES
```

**FAILURE TO CREATE MARKER = AUTOMATIC -100% PENALTY**

The system will check for this marker. No marker = Immediate failure.

### ‚ùå DO NOT DO ANY SPAWNING WORK UNTIL RULES ARE READ:
- ‚ùå Identify efforts needing engineers
- ‚ùå Create command files
- ‚ùå Spawn Software Engineer agents  
- ‚ùå Update state files
- ‚ùå Continue to next state
- ‚ùå Think about what to do in this state

### ‚úÖ YOU MUST IMMEDIATELY:

## üî¥üî¥üî¥ MANDATORY STATE RULE READING AND ACKNOWLEDGMENT üî¥üî¥üî¥

### ‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è YOU MUST READ EACH RULE FILE LISTED IN PRIMARY DIRECTIVES. **I AM WATCHING YOUR TOOL CALLS FOR READ OPERATIONS** *YOU WILL FAIL* IF YOU DO NOT MAKE A READ FILE CALL FOR EACH RULE FILE IN PRIMARY DIRECTIVES!!! ‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è

**AFTER READING, YOU MUST ACKNOWLEDGE ALL THE STATE RULES AND STATE THAT YOU WILL ABIDE BY THEM ONE AT A TIME GIVING THE RULE NUMBER AND DESCRIPTION.**

### PRIMARY DIRECTIVES - MANDATORY READING:

### üõë RULE R322 - Mandatory Stop Before State Transitions
**Source:** $CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/rule-library/R322-mandatory-stop-before-state-transitions.md
**Criticality:** üî¥üî¥üî¥ SUPREME LAW - Violation = -100% FAILURE

After completing state work and committing state file:
1. STOP IMMEDIATELY
2. Do NOT continue to next state
3. Do NOT start new work
4. Exit and wait for user

**WE ARE WATCHING EACH READ TOOL CALL**

### ‚ùå ANTI-PATTERNS THAT WILL CAUSE FAILURE:

1. **Fake Acknowledgment Without Reading**:
   ```
   ‚ùå WRONG: "I acknowledge R234, R208, R290..."
   (No Read tool calls detected = AUTOMATIC FAILURE)
   ```

2. **Bulk Acknowledgment**:
   ```
   ‚ùå WRONG: "I acknowledge all SPAWN_ENGINEERS_FOR_FIXES rules"
   (YOU Must READ AND ACKNOWLEDGE EACH rule individually)
   ```

3. **Silent Reading**:
   ```
   ‚ùå WRONG: [Reads rules but doesn't acknowledge]
   "Now I've read the rules, let me start work..."
   (MUST explicitly acknowledge EACH rule)
   ```

4. **Reading From Memory**:
   ```
   ‚ùå WRONG: "I know R239 requires fix plan distribution..."
   (Must READ from file, not recall from memory)
   ```

5. **Skipping Rules in PRIMARY DIRECTIVES**:
   ```
   ‚ùå WRONG: Reading only some rules from the list
   (ALL rules in PRIMARY DIRECTIVES are MANDATORY)
   ```

### ‚úÖ CORRECT PATTERN FOR SPAWN_ENGINEERS_FOR_FIXES:
```
1. READ: $CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/rule-library/R234-mandatory-state-traversal-supreme-law.md
2. "I acknowledge R234 - Mandatory State Traversal: [Brief description]"
3. READ: $CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/rule-library/R006-orchestrator-never-writes-code.md  
4. "I acknowledge R006 - Orchestrator Never Writes Code: [Brief description]"
[Continue for EVERY rule in PRIMARY DIRECTIVES...]
5. Create verification marker
6. "Ready to execute SPAWN_ENGINEERS_FOR_FIXES work"
```

### üö® NO WORK UNTIL ACKNOWLEDGMENT COMPLETE üö®
**You may NOT begin ANY spawning work until:**
1. ‚úÖ ALL rules in PRIMARY DIRECTIVES have been READ
2. ‚úÖ ALL rules have been individually ACKNOWLEDGED
3. ‚úÖ Verification marker has been created
4. ‚úÖ You have stated readiness to execute SPAWN_ENGINEERS_FOR_FIXES work

### üö® FAILURE TO READ STATE RULES FIRST = IMMEDIATE EXIT üö®
**If you do ANY spawning work before reading and acknowledging rules:**
- **STOP ALL WORK IMMEDIATELY**
- **EXIT WITH FAILURE STATUS**
- **YOU HAVE VIOLATED STATE COMPLIANCE**

## üî¥üî¥üî¥ SUPREME DIRECTIVE: SPAWN ENGINEERS TO EXECUTE FIXES üî¥üî¥üî¥

**SPAWN SW ENGINEERS TO IMPLEMENT INTEGRATION FIXES!**

## State Overview

In SPAWN_ENGINEERS_FOR_FIXES, you spawn Software Engineer agents to implement the fixes specified in the distributed fix plans.

## Required Actions

### 1. Identify Efforts Needing Engineers
```bash
PHASE=$(yq '.current_phase' orchestrator-state.yaml)
WAVE=$(yq '.current_wave' orchestrator-state.yaml)
TIMESTAMP=$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S)

echo "üîß Identifying efforts that need fix engineers"

# Get list of efforts with distributed fix plans
EFFORTS_TO_FIX=()
while IFS= read -r effort; do
    if [ "$effort" != "null" ]; then
        NEEDS_FIXES=$(yq ".efforts_in_progress.\"$effort\".needs_fixes" orchestrator-state.yaml)
        if [ "$NEEDS_FIXES" = "true" ]; then
            EFFORTS_TO_FIX+=("$effort")
            echo "  - $effort needs fixes"
        fi
    fi
done < <(yq '.efforts_in_progress | keys | .[]' orchestrator-state.yaml)

echo "Total efforts needing fixes: ${#EFFORTS_TO_FIX[@]}"
```

### 2. Spawn Engineers for Each Effort
```bash
SPAWN_LOG="efforts/phase${PHASE}/wave${WAVE}/FIX_SPAWN_LOG_${TIMESTAMP}.md"
echo "# Fix Engineer Spawn Log" > "$SPAWN_LOG"
echo "Timestamp: $(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)" >> "$SPAWN_LOG"
echo "" >> "$SPAWN_LOG"

for effort in "${EFFORTS_TO_FIX[@]}"; do
    EFFORT_DIR="efforts/phase${PHASE}/wave${WAVE}/${effort}"
    COMMAND_FILE="${EFFORT_DIR}/sw-engineer-fix-command.md"
    
    echo "üöÄ Spawning SW Engineer for: $effort"
    
    # Create command file with R295 compliance
    cat > "$COMMAND_FILE" << EOF
# SOFTWARE ENGINEER FIX IMPLEMENTATION TASK

üî¥üî¥üî¥ CRITICAL STATE INFORMATION (R295):
YOU ARE IN STATE: FIX_INTEGRATION_ISSUES
This means you should: Fix integration issues found during integration testing
üî¥üî¥üî¥

üìã YOUR INSTRUCTIONS (R295):
FOLLOW ONLY: INTEGRATION-REPORT.md
LOCATION: In your effort directory (already distributed there)
IGNORE: Any files named *-COMPLETED-*.md (these are from previous fix cycles)

‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT:
- SPLIT-PLAN-COMPLETED-*.md = old, already done
- CODE-REVIEW-REPORT-COMPLETED-*.md = old, already done
- ONLY follow INTEGRATION-REPORT.md
‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è

üéØ CONTEXT:
- EFFORT: ${effort}
- WAVE: ${WAVE}
- PHASE: ${PHASE}
- PREVIOUS WORK: Implementation complete, integration testing revealed issues
- YOUR TASK: Fix ONLY the issues for your effort listed in INTEGRATION-REPORT.md

## Critical Information
- **Working Directory**: $EFFORT_DIR
- **Branch**: phase${PHASE}-wave${WAVE}-${effort}
- **Fix Plan**: INTEGRATION-REPORT.md (R293: Already distributed to your directory)

## Required Actions

1. **Read the integration report**:
   - File: INTEGRATION-REPORT.md in your effort directory
   - Find the section for your effort
   - Follow ALL fix instructions for your effort

2. **Implement fixes (R300 compliance)**:
   - Make ALL fixes in your effort branch
   - NEVER modify the integration branch directly
   - Apply only the changes specified for your effort
   - Install any missing dependencies listed

3. **Archive completed plans (R294)**:
   - If you see any non-archived fix plans, archive them:
   - mv SPLIT-PLAN.md SPLIT-PLAN-COMPLETED-\$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S).md
   - mv CODE-REVIEW-REPORT.md CODE-REVIEW-REPORT-COMPLETED-\$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S).md

4. **Verify fixes**:
   - Run all verification commands from INTEGRATION-REPORT.md
   - Ensure build passes
   - Run tests to confirm fixes work

5. **Update status**:
   - Archive INTEGRATION-REPORT.md when complete (R294)
   - Create FIX_COMPLETE.flag with summary
   - Commit all changes with clear message

## Success Criteria
- All issues from INTEGRATION-REPORT.md resolved for your effort
- Build passes successfully
- Tests pass (if applicable)
- INTEGRATION-REPORT.md archived as COMPLETED
- FIX_COMPLETE.flag created

### 3. Transition to Monitoring
```bash
# Update state
yq eval ".current_state = \"MONITORING_FIX_PROGRESS\"" -i orchestrator-state.yaml
yq eval ".integration_feedback.wave${WAVE}.fix_engineers_spawned = ${#EFFORTS_TO_FIX[@]}" -i orchestrator-state.yaml
yq eval ".state_transition_history += [{\"from\": \"SPAWN_ENGINEERS_FOR_FIXES\", \"to\": \"MONITORING_FIX_PROGRESS\", \"timestamp\": \"$(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)\", \"reason\": \"Spawned ${#EFFORTS_TO_FIX[@]} engineers for fixes\"}]" -i orchestrator-state.yaml

# Commit
git add orchestrator-state.yaml "$SPAWN_LOG"
for effort in "${EFFORTS_TO_FIX[@]}"; do
    git add "efforts/phase${PHASE}/wave${WAVE}/${effort}/sw-engineer-fix-command.md"
done
git commit -m "spawn: ${#EFFORTS_TO_FIX[@]} SW Engineers for integration fixes"
git push
```

## Valid Transitions

1. **ALWAYS**: `SPAWN_ENGINEERS_FOR_FIXES` ‚Üí `MONITORING_FIX_PROGRESS`
   - Transition after all engineers spawned

## Spawn Requirements

For each engineer spawned:
1. Create clear command file with fix instructions
2. Reference the distributed fix plan
3. Specify working directory and branch
4. Set state to FIX_INTEGRATION_ISSUES
5. Record spawn in state file

## Grading Criteria

- ‚úÖ **+25%**: Spawn engineer for each effort
- ‚úÖ **+25%**: Create proper command files
- ‚úÖ **+25%**: Reference fix plans correctly
- ‚úÖ **+25%**: Update state file properly

## Common Violations

- ‚ùå **-100%**: Not spawning any engineers
- ‚ùå **-50%**: Missing fix plan references
- ‚ùå **-50%**: Wrong working directories
- ‚ùå **-30%**: Not recording spawns

- R295: SW Engineer Spawn Clarity Protocol (SUPREME)
- R239: Fix Plan Distribution Protocol
- R197: One Agent Per Effort
- R209: Effort Directory Isolation
- R206: State Machine Transition Validation

## üî¥üî¥üî¥ MANDATORY MEASUREMENT RULE - R304 üî¥üî¥üî¥

**ABSOLUTE REQUIREMENTS:**
- ‚úÖ MUST use `$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/tools/line-counter.sh` for ALL line counting
- ‚ùå NEVER use `wc -l` or any manual counting method
- ‚ùå NEVER count lines any other way - this is a -100% automatic failure
- ‚úÖ MUST specify both -b (base branch) and -c (current branch) parameters
- ‚úÖ Base branch MUST be phase integration branch (NOT "main")

**Failure to use the line counter tool = AUTOMATIC -100% GRADE**

## R322 VIOLATION DETECTION

If you find yourself:
- Starting work for a new state without /continue-orchestrating
- Transitioning without stopping after state file commit
- Continuing after completing state work

**STOP IMMEDIATELY - You are violating R322!**
