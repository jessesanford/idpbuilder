# Orchestrator - SPAWN_CODE_REVIEWERS_FOR_REVIEW State Rules

## üî¥üî¥üî¥ R290 ENFORCEMENT: READ THESE RULES FIRST! üî¥üî¥üî¥

**SUPREME LAW #3 (R290): STATE RULES MUST BE READ BEFORE STATE ACTIONS**

## üî¥üî¥üî¥ STOP! STATE RULE READING IS ABSOLUTELY FIRST! üî¥üî¥üî¥

**YOU HAVE ENTERED SPAWN_CODE_REVIEWERS_FOR_REVIEW STATE - YOU MUST READ AND ACKNOWLEDGE ALL STATE RULES BEFORE DOING ANY STATE WORK!**

## üî¥üî¥üî¥ R290 VERIFICATION REQUIREMENT üî¥üî¥üî¥

**R290 ENFORCEMENT: CREATE VERIFICATION MARKER AFTER READING**

After reading and acknowledging all state rules, you MUST create a verification marker:

```bash
# MANDATORY: Create verification marker after reading rules
touch .state_rules_read_orchestrator_SPAWN_CODE_REVIEWERS_FOR_REVIEW
echo "$(date +%s) - Rules read and acknowledged for SPAWN_CODE_REVIEWERS_FOR_REVIEW" > .state_rules_read_orchestrator_SPAWN_CODE_REVIEWERS_FOR_REVIEW
```

**FAILURE TO CREATE MARKER = AUTOMATIC -100% PENALTY**

The system will check for this marker. No marker = Immediate failure.

### ‚ùå DO NOT DO ANY SPAWN_CODE_REVIEWERS_FOR_REVIEW WORK UNTIL RULES ARE READ:
- ‚ùå Start spawn code reviewer agents
- ‚ùå Start assign review work
- ‚ùå Start distribute review tasks
- ‚ùå Update state files
- ‚ùå Continue to next state
- ‚ùå Think about what to do in this state

### ‚úÖ YOU MUST IMMEDIATELY:

## üî¥üî¥üî¥ MANDATORY STATE RULE READING AND ACKNOWLEDGMENT üî¥üî¥üî¥

### ‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è YOU MUST READ EACH RULE FILE LISTED IN PRIMARY DIRECTIVES. **I AM WATCHING YOUR TOOL CALLS FOR READ OPERATIONS** *YOU WILL FAIL* IF YOU DO NOT MAKE A READ FILE CALL FOR EACH RULE FILE IN PRIMARY DIRECTIVES!!! ‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è

**AFTER READING, YOU MUST ACKNOWLEDGE ALL THE STATE RULES AND STATE THAT YOU WILL ABIDE BY THEM ONE AT A TIME GIVING THE RULE NUMBER AND DESCRIPTION.**

### ‚ùå ANTI-PATTERNS THAT WILL CAUSE FAILURE:

1. **Fake Acknowledgment Without Reading**:
   ```
   ‚ùå WRONG: "I acknowledge R151, R208, R053..."
   (No Read tool calls detected = AUTOMATIC FAILURE)
   ```

2. **Bulk Acknowledgment**:
   ```
   ‚ùå WRONG: "I acknowledge all SPAWN_CODE_REVIEWERS_FOR_REVIEW rules"
   (YOU Must READ AND ACKNOWLEDGE EACH rule individually)
   ```

3. **Silent Reading**:
   ```
   ‚ùå WRONG: [Reads rules but doesn't acknowledge]
   "Now I've read the rules, let me start work..."
   (MUST explicitly acknowledge EACH rule)
   ```

4. **Reading From Memory**:
   ```
   ‚ùå WRONG: "I know R208 requires CD before spawn..."
   (Must READ from file, not recall from memory)
   ```

5. **Skipping Rules in PRIMARY DIRECTIVES**:
   ```
   ‚ùå WRONG: Reading only some rules from the list
   (ALL rules in PRIMARY DIRECTIVES are MANDATORY)
   ```

### ‚úÖ CORRECT PATTERN FOR SPAWN_CODE_REVIEWERS_FOR_REVIEW:
```
1. READ: $CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/rule-library/[first-rule-file].md
2. "I acknowledge [Rule#] - [Rule Name]: [Brief description]"
3. READ: $CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/rule-library/[second-rule-file].md  
4. "I acknowledge [Rule#] - [Rule Name]: [Brief description]"
[Continue for EVERY rule in PRIMARY DIRECTIVES...]
5. "Ready to execute SPAWN_CODE_REVIEWERS_FOR_REVIEW work"
```

### üö® NO WORK UNTIL ACKNOWLEDGMENT COMPLETE üö®
**You may NOT begin ANY SPAWN_CODE_REVIEWERS_FOR_REVIEW work until:**
1. ‚úÖ ALL rules in PRIMARY DIRECTIVES have been READ
2. ‚úÖ ALL rules have been individually ACKNOWLEDGED
3. ‚úÖ You have stated readiness to execute SPAWN_CODE_REVIEWERS_FOR_REVIEW work
1. **READ** every rule file listed in PRIMARY DIRECTIVES below
2. **ACKNOWLEDGE** each rule individually with number and description
3. **ONLY THEN** proceed with SPAWN_CODE_REVIEWERS_FOR_REVIEW work

### üö® FAILURE TO READ STATE RULES FIRST = IMMEDIATE EXIT üö®
**If you do ANY SPAWN_CODE_REVIEWERS_FOR_REVIEW work before reading and acknowledging rules:**
- **STOP ALL WORK IMMEDIATELY**
- **EXIT WITH FAILURE STATUS**
- **YOU HAVE VIOLATED STATE COMPLIANCE**

**THE SYSTEM IS MONITORING YOUR READ TOOL CALLS!**

## üìã PRIMARY DIRECTIVES FOR SPAWN_CODE_REVIEWERS_FOR_REVIEW

**YOU MUST READ EACH RULE LISTED HERE. YOUR READ TOOL CALLS ARE BEING MONITORED.**

## üî¥üî¥üî¥ MANDATORY MEASUREMENT RULE - R304 üî¥üî¥üî¥

**ABSOLUTE REQUIREMENTS:**
- ‚úÖ MUST use `$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/tools/line-counter.sh` for ALL line counting
- ‚ùå NEVER use `wc -l` or any manual counting method
- ‚ùå NEVER count lines any other way - this is a -100% automatic failure
- ‚úÖ MUST specify both -b (base branch) and -c (current branch) parameters
- ‚úÖ Base branch MUST be phase integration branch (NOT "main")

**Failure to use the line counter tool = AUTOMATIC -100% GRADE**

### State-Specific Rules (NOT in orchestrator.md):

1. **üö®üö®üö® R151** - Parallel Spawning Timestamp Requirement
   - File: `$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/rule-library/R151-parallel-agent-spawning-timing.md`
   - Criticality: CRITICAL - Timestamps must be within 5s for parallel agents
   - Summary: All parallel agents must emit timestamps within 5 seconds

2. **R108** - Code Review Protocol
   - File: `$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/rule-library/R108-code-review-protocol.md`
   - Criticality: BLOCKING - Complete review protocol
   - Summary: Review for size limits, quality, patterns, and create reports

3. **R222** - Code Review Gate
   - File: `$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/rule-library/R222-code-review-gate.md`
   - Criticality: BLOCKING - Must create standardized reports
   - Summary: Generate CODE-REVIEW-REPORT.md for all findings

4. **R255** - Post-Agent Work Verification
   - File: `$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/rule-library/R255-post-agent-work-verification.md`
   - Criticality: BLOCKING - Verify correct locations after completion
   - Summary: Ensure all review work is in correct directories

5. **üî¥üî¥üî¥ R208** - CD Before Agent Spawn (SUPREME LAW)
   - File: `$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/rule-library/R208-cd-before-agent-spawn.md`
   - Criticality: SUPREME LAW - CD to correct directory before spawn
   - Summary: Must change to agent's working directory before spawning

**Note**: Additional TODO persistence rules (R287) apply from orchestrator.md.

## üö® SPAWN_CODE_REVIEWERS_FOR_REVIEW IS A VERB - START SPAWNING IMMEDIATELY! üö®

**See R151 for immediate action requirements when entering this state.**

The SPAWN_CODE_REVIEWERS_FOR_REVIEW state requires IMMEDIATE spawning action - no pausing or waiting.

## State Context
You are spawning Code Reviewer agents to review:
- Completed implementation work from SW Engineers
- **INTEGRATION FIXES** when coming from MONITORING_FIX_PROGRESS
- Any code that needs review before proceeding

## üî¥üî¥üî¥ PREREQUISITES FOR SPAWN_CODE_REVIEWERS_FOR_REVIEW üî¥üî¥üî¥

**BEFORE ENTERING THIS STATE, YOU MUST ALREADY HAVE:**
1. ‚úÖ All SW Engineers completed their implementation
2. ‚úÖ All code committed and pushed by SW Engineers
3. ‚úÖ Size measurements completed and within limits
4. ‚úÖ All effort directories contain implemented code
5. ‚úÖ **PARALLELIZATION ANALYSIS COMPLETE (ANALYZE_CODE_REVIEWER_PARALLELIZATION)**
6. ‚úÖ **Code Reviewer parallelization plan in orchestrator-state.yaml**

**IF PARALLELIZATION NOT ANALYZED, GO BACK TO ANALYZE_CODE_REVIEWER_PARALLELIZATION!**

## Review Assignment Protocol

### For Each Code Reviewer to Spawn:
1. **CD to effort directory** (R208 SUPREME LAW)
2. **Spawn with clear review scope**:
   - Which efforts to review
   - What type of review (code quality, size, patterns)
   - Where to create reports
3. **Track spawn timestamps** (R151 requirement)
4. **Monitor completion** via orchestrator-state.yaml

### Parallel vs Sequential Spawning:
- **Parallel**: When reviewing independent efforts
- **Sequential**: When reviewing split efforts or dependencies
- **Decision made in**: ANALYZE_CODE_REVIEWER_PARALLELIZATION state

## Expected Deliverables

Each Code Reviewer must produce:
1. **CODE-REVIEW-REPORT.md** in effort directory
2. **Size compliance verification**
3. **Quality assessment**
4. **Recommendations for fixes if needed**

## üö®üö®üö® SPECIAL CASE: REVIEWING INTEGRATION FIXES üö®üö®üö®

**When coming from MONITORING_FIX_PROGRESS:**
1. You are reviewing FIXES to integration issues
2. Focus review on:
   - Did the fixes resolve the integration problems?
   - Are the fixes properly implemented?
   - Do the fixes maintain code quality?
3. After successful review of fixes:
   - Transition to MONITOR state
   - Then to WAVE_COMPLETE
   - Then BACK TO INTEGRATION for full re-run
4. **NEVER skip directly to MONITORING_INTEGRATION**

## State Transitions

From SPAWN_CODE_REVIEWERS_FOR_REVIEW:
- **REVIEWERS_COMPLETE** ‚Üí WAVE_COMPLETE (All reviews done)
- **REVIEWS_FAILED** ‚Üí ERROR_RECOVERY (Critical issues found)
- **NEED_FIXES** ‚Üí SPAWN_AGENTS (Re-spawn SW Engineers for fixes)
- **When reviewing fixes** ‚Üí MONITOR ‚Üí WAVE_COMPLETE ‚Üí INTEGRATION (re-run)

## Critical Rule Enforcement Order

1. **R290**: Read these state rules FIRST and create verification marker
3. **R208**: CD to correct directory BEFORE spawning
4. **R151**: Ensure parallel timestamps within 5s
5. **R053**: Follow complete review protocol
6. **R054**: Generate standardized reports
7. **R255**: Verify work in correct locations

**Remember**: Code Reviewers check for size violations, quality issues, and create actionable reports for the orchestrator.

## R322 VIOLATION DETECTION

If you find yourself:
- Starting work for a new state without /continue-orchestrating
- Transitioning without stopping after state file commit
- Continuing after completing state work

**STOP IMMEDIATELY - You are violating R322!**
