## üî¥üî¥üî¥ R290 ENFORCEMENT: READ THESE RULES FIRST! üî¥üî¥üî¥

**SUPREME LAW #3 (R290): STATE RULES MUST BE READ BEFORE STATE ACTIONS**

## üî¥üî¥üî¥ STOP! STATE RULE READING IS ABSOLUTELY FIRST! üî¥üî¥üî¥

**YOU HAVE ENTERED MONITORING_FIX_PROGRESS STATE - YOU MUST READ AND ACKNOWLEDGE ALL STATE RULES BEFORE DOING ANY STATE WORK!**

## üî¥üî¥üî¥ R290 VERIFICATION REQUIREMENT üî¥üî¥üî¥

**R290 ENFORCEMENT: CREATE VERIFICATION MARKER AFTER READING**

After reading and acknowledging all state rules, you MUST create a verification marker:

```bash
# MANDATORY: Create verification marker after reading rules
touch .state_rules_read_orchestrator_MONITORING_FIX_PROGRESS
echo "$(date +%s) - Rules read and acknowledged for MONITORING_FIX_PROGRESS" > .state_rules_read_orchestrator_MONITORING_FIX_PROGRESS
```

**FAILURE TO CREATE MARKER = AUTOMATIC -100% PENALTY**

The system will check for this marker. No marker = Immediate failure.

### ‚ùå DO NOT DO ANY MONITORING WORK UNTIL RULES ARE READ:
- ‚ùå Check fix progress for efforts
- ‚ùå Verify completion flags
- ‚ùå Check engineer processes
- ‚ùå Update state files
- ‚ùå Continue to next state
- ‚ùå Think about what to do in this state

### ‚úÖ YOU MUST IMMEDIATELY:

## üî¥üî¥üî¥ MANDATORY STATE RULE READING AND ACKNOWLEDGMENT üî¥üî¥üî¥

### ‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è YOU MUST READ EACH RULE FILE LISTED IN PRIMARY DIRECTIVES. **I AM WATCHING YOUR TOOL CALLS FOR READ OPERATIONS** *YOU WILL FAIL* IF YOU DO NOT MAKE A READ FILE CALL FOR EACH RULE FILE IN PRIMARY DIRECTIVES!!! ‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è

**AFTER READING, YOU MUST ACKNOWLEDGE ALL THE STATE RULES AND STATE THAT YOU WILL ABIDE BY THEM ONE AT A TIME GIVING THE RULE NUMBER AND DESCRIPTION.**

### PRIMARY DIRECTIVES - MANDATORY READING:

### üõë RULE R322 - Mandatory Stop Before State Transitions
**Source:** $CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/rule-library/R322-mandatory-stop-before-state-transitions.md
**Criticality:** üî¥üî¥üî¥ SUPREME LAW - Violation = -100% FAILURE

After completing state work and committing state file:
1. STOP IMMEDIATELY
2. Do NOT continue to next state
3. Do NOT start new work
4. Exit and wait for user

**USE THESE EXACT READ COMMANDS (IN THIS ORDER):**
1. Read: $CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/rule-library/R234-mandatory-state-traversal-supreme-law.md
2. Read: $CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/rule-library/R006-orchestrator-never-writes-code.md
3. Read: $CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/rule-library/R290-state-rule-reading-verification-supreme-law.md

8. Read: $CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/rule-library/R206-state-machine-transition-validation.md

**WE ARE WATCHING EACH READ TOOL CALL**

### ‚ùå ANTI-PATTERNS THAT WILL CAUSE FAILURE:

1. **Fake Acknowledgment Without Reading**:
   ```
   ‚ùå WRONG: "I acknowledge R234, R208, R290..."
   (No Read tool calls detected = AUTOMATIC FAILURE)
   ```

2. **Bulk Acknowledgment**:
   ```
   ‚ùå WRONG: "I acknowledge all MONITORING_FIX_PROGRESS rules"
   (YOU Must READ AND ACKNOWLEDGE EACH rule individually)
   ```

3. **Silent Reading**:
   ```
   ‚ùå WRONG: [Reads rules but doesn't acknowledge]
   "Now I've read the rules, let me start work..."
   (MUST explicitly acknowledge EACH rule)
   ```

4. **Reading From Memory**:
   ```
   ‚ùå WRONG: "I know R008 requires monitoring progress..."
   (Must READ from file, not recall from memory)
   ```

5. **Skipping Rules in PRIMARY DIRECTIVES**:
   ```
   ‚ùå WRONG: Reading only some rules from the list
   (ALL rules in PRIMARY DIRECTIVES are MANDATORY)
   ```

### ‚úÖ CORRECT PATTERN FOR MONITORING_FIX_PROGRESS:
```
1. READ: $CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/rule-library/R234-mandatory-state-traversal-supreme-law.md
2. "I acknowledge R234 - Mandatory State Traversal: [Brief description]"
3. READ: $CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/rule-library/R006-orchestrator-never-writes-code.md  
4. "I acknowledge R006 - Orchestrator Never Writes Code: [Brief description]"
[Continue for EVERY rule in PRIMARY DIRECTIVES...]
5. Create verification marker
6. "Ready to execute MONITORING_FIX_PROGRESS work"
```

### üö® NO WORK UNTIL ACKNOWLEDGMENT COMPLETE üö®
**You may NOT begin ANY monitoring work until:**
1. ‚úÖ ALL rules in PRIMARY DIRECTIVES have been READ
2. ‚úÖ ALL rules have been individually ACKNOWLEDGED
3. ‚úÖ Verification marker has been created
4. ‚úÖ You have stated readiness to execute MONITORING_FIX_PROGRESS work

### üö® FAILURE TO READ STATE RULES FIRST = IMMEDIATE EXIT üö®
**If you do ANY monitoring work before reading and acknowledging rules:**
- **STOP ALL WORK IMMEDIATELY**
- **EXIT WITH FAILURE STATUS**
- **YOU HAVE VIOLATED STATE COMPLIANCE**

## üî¥üî¥üî¥ SUPREME DIRECTIVE: MONITOR FIX IMPLEMENTATION PROGRESS üî¥üî¥üî¥

**TRACK ENGINEERS IMPLEMENTING FIXES AND VERIFY COMPLETION!**

## State Overview

In MONITORING_FIX_PROGRESS, you monitor Software Engineers implementing integration fixes and determine when all fixes are complete.

## Required Actions

### 1. Check Fix Progress for Each Effort
```bash
PHASE=$(jq '.current_phase' orchestrator-state.json)
WAVE=$(jq '.current_wave' orchestrator-state.json)

echo "üìä Monitoring fix progress for wave ${WAVE}"

# Track completion status
ALL_FIXES_COMPLETE=true
FIXES_COMPLETE=()
FIXES_PENDING=()

# Check each effort that needs fixes
while IFS= read -r effort; do
    if [ "$effort" != "null" ]; then
        NEEDS_FIXES=$(jq ".efforts_in_progress.\"$effort\".needs_fixes" orchestrator-state.json)
        
        if [ "$NEEDS_FIXES" = "true" ]; then
            EFFORT_DIR="efforts/phase${PHASE}/wave${WAVE}/${effort}"
            
            # Check for completion flag
            if [ -f "${EFFORT_DIR}/FIX_COMPLETE.flag" ]; then
                echo "‚úÖ $effort: Fixes complete"
                FIXES_COMPLETE+=("$effort")
                
                # Update state file
                jq ".efforts_in_progress.\"$effort\".fixes_completed = \"$(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)\"" -i orchestrator-state.json
                jq ".efforts_in_progress.\"$effort\".needs_fixes = false" -i orchestrator-state.json
            elif [ -f "${EFFORT_DIR}/FIX_REQUIRED.flag" ]; then
                echo "‚è≥ $effort: Fixes still in progress"
                FIXES_PENDING+=("$effort")
                ALL_FIXES_COMPLETE=false
                
                # Check if engineer is still working
                if ! pgrep -f "sw-engineer.*${effort}" > /dev/null; then
                    echo "  ‚ö†Ô∏è Warning: No engineer process found for $effort"
                    # May need to respawn or check for issues
                fi
            else
                echo "‚ùì $effort: Unknown fix status"
                ALL_FIXES_COMPLETE=false
            fi
        fi
    fi
done < <(jq '.efforts_in_progress | keys | .[]' orchestrator-state.json)

echo "Fixes complete: ${#FIXES_COMPLETE[@]}"
echo "Fixes pending: ${#FIXES_PENDING[@]}"
```

### 2. üî¥üî¥üî¥ VERIFY FIXES IN EFFORT BRANCHES (R300) üî¥üî¥üî¥
```bash
if [ "$ALL_FIXES_COMPLETE" = true ]; then
    echo "‚úÖ All fixes complete! Verifying fixes are in effort branches (R300)..."
    
    # R300 MANDATORY VERIFICATION
    VERIFICATION_FAILED=false
    for effort in "${FIXES_COMPLETE[@]}"; do
        EFFORT_BRANCH="phase${PHASE}-wave${WAVE}-${effort}"
        
        # Check remote branch for fix commits
        git fetch origin ${EFFORT_BRANCH} 2>/dev/null
        FIX_COMMIT=$(git log origin/${EFFORT_BRANCH} --oneline --grep="fix:" --since="2 hours ago" 2>/dev/null | head -1)
        
        if [ -z "$FIX_COMMIT" ]; then
            echo "‚ùå R300 VIOLATION: No fix commits found in origin/${EFFORT_BRANCH}!"
            VERIFICATION_FAILED=true
        else
            echo "‚úÖ Verified fix in ${EFFORT_BRANCH}: ${FIX_COMMIT}"
        fi
    done
    
    if [ "$VERIFICATION_FAILED" = true ]; then
        echo "üî¥üî¥üî¥ R300 VIOLATION: Fixes missing from effort branches! üî¥üî¥üî¥"
        UPDATE_STATE="ERROR_RECOVERY"
        UPDATE_REASON="R300 violation - fixes not in effort branches"
    else
        echo "‚úÖ R300 PASSED: All fixes verified in effort branches"
        # CRITICAL: MUST review the fixed code - NEVER skip to MONITORING_INTEGRATION
        UPDATE_STATE="SPAWN_CODE_REVIEWERS_FOR_REVIEW"  # ONLY valid success transition
        UPDATE_REASON="All integration fixes complete and verified in effort branches (R300)"
    fi
    
    # Record completion
    jq ".integration_feedback.wave${WAVE}.all_fixes_completed = \"$(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)\"" -i orchestrator-state.json
else
    echo "‚è≥ Still waiting for ${#FIXES_PENDING[@]} fixes to complete"
    
    # Check for timeout (30 minutes per effort)
    SPAWN_TIME=$(jq ".integration_feedback.wave${WAVE}.fix_engineers_spawned" orchestrator-state.json 2>/dev/null)
    if [ -n "$SPAWN_TIME" ]; then
        CURRENT_TIME=$(date +%s)
        SPAWN_TIMESTAMP=$(date -d "$SPAWN_TIME" +%s 2>/dev/null || echo 0)
        ELAPSED=$((CURRENT_TIME - SPAWN_TIMESTAMP))
        MAX_TIME=$((30 * 60 * ${#FIXES_PENDING[@]}))  # 30 minutes per effort
        
        if [ $ELAPSED -gt $MAX_TIME ]; then
            echo "‚ùå Timeout: Fixes taking too long (>${MAX_TIME}s)"
            UPDATE_STATE="ERROR_RECOVERY"
            UPDATE_REASON="Fix implementation timeout"
        else
            # Stay in MONITORING_FIX_PROGRESS
            echo "Continuing to monitor... (${ELAPSED}s elapsed)"
            sleep 10
        fi
    fi
fi
```

### 3. Update State When Ready
```bash
if [ -n "$UPDATE_STATE" ]; then
    # Update state
    jq ".current_state = \"$UPDATE_STATE\"" -i orchestrator-state.json
    jq ".state_transition_history += [{\"from\": \"MONITORING_FIX_PROGRESS\", \"to\": \"$UPDATE_STATE\", \"timestamp\": \"$(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)\", \"reason\": \"$UPDATE_REASON\"}]" -i orchestrator-state.json
    
    # Commit
    git add orchestrator-state.json
    git commit -m "state: Transitioning to $UPDATE_STATE - $UPDATE_REASON"
    git push
fi
```

## üî¥üî¥üî¥ CRITICAL: ONLY ONE VALID SUCCESS TRANSITION üî¥üî¥üî¥

**WHEN FIXES ARE COMPLETE, YOU MUST:**
1. Transition to SPAWN_CODE_REVIEWERS_FOR_REVIEW (ONLY valid success path)
2. NEVER go directly to MONITORING_INTEGRATION
3. NEVER manually copy files to integration workspace
4. Wait for code review to pass
5. Then return to INTEGRATION state for full re-run

**INVALID TRANSITIONS (IMMEDIATE -100% FAILURE):**
- MONITORING_FIX_PROGRESS ‚Üí MONITORING_INTEGRATION ‚ùå **ABSOLUTELY FORBIDDEN**
- MONITORING_FIX_PROGRESS ‚Üí INTEGRATION ‚ùå **SKIP REVIEW = FAILURE**
- MONITORING_FIX_PROGRESS ‚Üí WAVE_COMPLETE ‚ùå **NO SHORTCUTS**
- MONITORING_FIX_PROGRESS ‚Üí Any state except SPAWN_CODE_REVIEWERS_FOR_REVIEW ‚ùå

## Valid Transitions

1. **SUCCESS Path (ONLY VALID SUCCESS PATH)**: `MONITORING_FIX_PROGRESS` ‚Üí `SPAWN_CODE_REVIEWERS_FOR_REVIEW`
   - When: All fixes completed successfully
   - **THIS IS THE ONLY ACCEPTABLE SUCCESS TRANSITION**
   
2. **TIMEOUT Path**: `MONITORING_FIX_PROGRESS` ‚Üí `ERROR_RECOVERY`
   - When: Fixes exceed timeout (30 minutes per effort)
   
3. **CONTINUE Path**: `MONITORING_FIX_PROGRESS` ‚Üí `MONITORING_FIX_PROGRESS`
   - When: Still waiting for fixes to complete

## üö®üö®üö® MANDATORY WAVE INTEGRATION RE-RUN PROTOCOL üö®üö®üö®

**CRITICAL: After wave fixes are complete, you MUST re-run the ENTIRE wave integration!**

### Why Re-Integration Is MANDATORY:
- Fixes were applied to EFFORT branches (the source branches)
- The wave-integration branch still has the BROKEN code
- You MUST re-merge all effort branches to get fixes into integration
- Without re-integration, the wave cannot proceed to phase integration

### The CORRECT Wave Re-Integration Cycle:
```
MONITORING_FIX_PROGRESS (all wave fixes complete)
    ‚Üì
SPAWN_CODE_REVIEWERS_FOR_REVIEW (review the fixes in effort branches)
    ‚Üì
MONITOR_REVIEWS (monitor review progress)
    ‚Üì
WAVE_COMPLETE (if reviews pass - marks wave ready for re-integration)
    ‚Üì
INTEGRATION (DELETE old integration, create FRESH from main)
    ‚Üì
SPAWN_CODE_REVIEWER_MERGE_PLAN (create NEW merge plan)
    ‚Üì
SPAWN_INTEGRATION_AGENT (re-merge ALL effort branches with fixes)
    ‚Üì
MONITORING_INTEGRATION (monitor new integration attempt)
    ‚Üì
If fails ‚Üí IMMEDIATE_BACKPORT_REQUIRED ‚Üí fix sources ‚Üí repeat cycle
If succeeds ‚Üí WAVE_REVIEW ‚Üí proceed to next wave or phase
```

### What ACTUALLY Happens During Re-Integration:
1. **Delete the broken wave-integration branch**
2. **Create fresh wave-integration from main**
3. **Re-execute ENTIRE merge plan** (all efforts in sequence)
4. **Fixed code from effort branches now merged**
5. **Wave can finally build and pass tests**

### NEVER DO THESE (AUTOMATIC FAILURE):
- ‚ùå Manually copy fixed files to integration workspace
- ‚ùå Skip the integration plan and go directly to monitoring
- ‚ùå Assume fixes will "just work" without re-integration
- ‚ùå Bypass the full integration process
- ‚ùå Cherry-pick fixes instead of proper branch merging
- ‚ùå Edit code directly in integration branch (R321 violation)

## Monitoring Requirements

1. Check each effort's FIX_COMPLETE.flag
2. Track which efforts are complete vs pending
3. Monitor for timeout conditions
4. Update state file with completion timestamps
5. Transition when all fixes complete

## Grading Criteria

- ‚úÖ **+25%**: Accurately track fix progress
- ‚úÖ **+25%**: Detect completion correctly
- ‚úÖ **+25%**: Handle timeouts properly
- ‚úÖ **+25%**: Update state appropriately

## Common Violations

- ‚ùå **-100%**: Not checking completion flags
- ‚ùå **-50%**: Missing timeout detection
- ‚ùå **-50%**: Wrong state transitions
- ‚ùå **-30%**: Not updating state file

## Related Rules

- R008: Monitoring Frequency
- R239: Fix Plan Distribution Protocol
- R206: State Machine Transition Validation

## üî¥üî¥üî¥ MANDATORY MEASUREMENT RULE - R304 üî¥üî¥üî¥

**ABSOLUTE REQUIREMENTS:**
- ‚úÖ MUST use `$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/tools/line-counter.sh` for ALL line counting
- ‚ùå NEVER use `wc -l` or any manual counting method
- ‚ùå NEVER count lines any other way - this is a -100% automatic failure
- ‚úÖ MUST specify both -b (base branch) and -c (current branch) parameters
- ‚úÖ Base branch MUST be phase integration branch (NOT "main")

**Failure to use the line counter tool = AUTOMATIC -100% GRADE**

## R322 VIOLATION DETECTION

If you find yourself:
- Starting work for a new state without /continue-orchestrating
- Transitioning without stopping after state file commit
- Continuing after completing state work

**STOP IMMEDIATELY - You are violating R322!**
