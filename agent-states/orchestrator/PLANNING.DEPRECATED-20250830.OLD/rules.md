## üî¥üî¥üî¥ R290 ENFORCEMENT: READ THESE RULES FIRST! üî¥üî¥üî¥

**SUPREME LAW #3 (R290): STATE RULES MUST BE READ BEFORE STATE ACTIONS**

## üî¥üî¥üî¥ STOP! STATE RULE READING IS ABSOLUTELY FIRST! üî¥üî¥üî¥

**YOU HAVE ENTERED PLANNING STATE - YOU MUST READ AND ACKNOWLEDGE ALL STATE RULES BEFORE DOING ANY STATE WORK!**

## üî¥üî¥üî¥ R290 VERIFICATION REQUIREMENT üî¥üî¥üî¥

**R290 ENFORCEMENT: CREATE VERIFICATION MARKER AFTER READING**

After reading and acknowledging all state rules, you MUST create a verification marker:

```bash
# MANDATORY: Create verification marker after reading rules
touch .state_rules_read_orchestrator_PLANNING
echo "$(date +%s) - Rules read and acknowledged for PLANNING" > .state_rules_read_orchestrator_PLANNING
```

**FAILURE TO CREATE MARKER = AUTOMATIC -100% PENALTY**

The system will check for this marker. No marker = Immediate failure.

### ‚ùå DO NOT DO ANY PLANNING WORK UNTIL RULES ARE READ:
- ‚ùå Start load planning templates
- ‚ùå Start spawn architects
- ‚ùå Start request implementation plans
- ‚ùå Start create phase plans
- ‚ùå Update state files
- ‚ùå Continue to next state
- ‚ùå Think about what to do in this state

### ‚úÖ YOU MUST IMMEDIATELY:

## üî¥üî¥üî¥ MANDATORY STATE RULE READING AND ACKNOWLEDGMENT üî¥üî¥üî¥

### ‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è YOU MUST READ EACH RULE FILE LISTED IN PRIMARY DIRECTIVES. **I AM WATCHING YOUR TOOL CALLS FOR READ OPERATIONS** *YOU WILL FAIL* IF YOU DO NOT MAKE A READ FILE CALL FOR EACH RULE FILE IN PRIMARY DIRECTIVES!!! ‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è

**AFTER READING, YOU MUST ACKNOWLEDGE ALL THE STATE RULES AND STATE THAT YOU WILL ABIDE BY THEM ONE AT A TIME GIVING THE RULE NUMBER AND DESCRIPTION.**

### ‚ùå ANTI-PATTERNS THAT WILL CAUSE FAILURE:

1. **Fake Acknowledgment Without Reading**:
   ```
   ‚ùå WRONG: "I acknowledge R151, R208, R053..."
   (No Read tool calls detected = AUTOMATIC FAILURE)
   ```

2. **Bulk Acknowledgment**:
   ```
   ‚ùå WRONG: "I acknowledge all PLANNING rules"
   (YOU Must READ AND ACKNOWLEDGE EACH rule individually)
   ```

3. **Silent Reading**:
   ```
   ‚ùå WRONG: [Reads rules but doesn't acknowledge]
   "Now I've read the rules, let me start work..."
   (MUST explicitly acknowledge EACH rule)
   ```

4. **Reading From Memory**:
   ```
   ‚ùå WRONG: "I know R208 requires CD before spawn..."
   (Must READ from file, not recall from memory)
   ```

5. **Skipping Rules in PRIMARY DIRECTIVES**:
   ```
   ‚ùå WRONG: Reading only some rules from the list
   (ALL rules in PRIMARY DIRECTIVES are MANDATORY)
   ```

### ‚úÖ CORRECT PATTERN FOR PLANNING:
```
1. READ: $CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/rule-library/[first-rule-file].md
2. "I acknowledge [Rule#] - [Rule Name]: [Brief description]"
3. READ: $CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/rule-library/[second-rule-file].md  
4. "I acknowledge [Rule#] - [Rule Name]: [Brief description]"
[Continue for EVERY rule in PRIMARY DIRECTIVES...]
5. "Ready to execute PLANNING work"
```

### üö® NO WORK UNTIL ACKNOWLEDGMENT COMPLETE üö®
**You may NOT begin ANY PLANNING work until:**
1. ‚úÖ ALL rules in PRIMARY DIRECTIVES have been READ
2. ‚úÖ ALL rules have been individually ACKNOWLEDGED
3. ‚úÖ You have stated readiness to execute PLANNING work
1. **READ** every rule file listed in PRIMARY DIRECTIVES below
2. **ACKNOWLEDGE** each rule individually with number and description
3. **ONLY THEN** proceed with PLANNING work

### üö® FAILURE TO READ STATE RULES FIRST = IMMEDIATE EXIT üö®
**If you do ANY PLANNING work before reading and acknowledging rules:**
- **STOP ALL WORK IMMEDIATELY**
- **EXIT WITH FAILURE STATUS**
- **YOU HAVE VIOLATED STATE COMPLIANCE**

**THE SYSTEM IS MONITORING YOUR READ TOOL CALLS!**

## üìã PRIMARY DIRECTIVES FOR PLANNING STATE

### üö®üö®üö® R109 - Planning Rules
**File**: `$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/rule-library/R109-planning-rules.md`
**Criticality**: BLOCKING - Must follow planning templates
**Summary**: Use correct templates for master, phase, and effort planning

### üö®üö®üö® R287 - TODO Persistence Suite
**Files**:
- R287: `$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/rule-library/R287-todo-save-triggers.md`
- R287: `$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/rule-library/R287-todo-save-frequency.md`
- R287: `$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/rule-library/R287-todo-commit-protocol.md`
- R287: `$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/rule-library/R287-todo-recovery-verification.md`
**Criticality**: BLOCKING - TODO loss = -50% to -100% penalty
**Summary**: Save TODOs within 30s, every 10 messages/15 min, commit within 60s

### üî¥üî¥üî¥ R288 - State File Update and Commit Protocol (SUPREME LAW)
**File**: `$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/rule-library/R288-state-file-update-and-commit-protocol.md`
**Criticality**: SUPREME LAW - Update on every transition
**Summary**: Update orchestrator-state.json on all state changes

### üö®üö®üö® R288 - State File Update and Commit Protocol

**Summary**: Commit and push state file immediately after updates

## üö® PLANNING IS A VERB - START PLANNING IMMEDIATELY! üö®

### IMMEDIATE ACTIONS UPON ENTERING PLANNING

**THE MOMENT YOU ENTER THIS STATE, YOU MUST:**
1. Determine which level of planning is needed NOW (master/phase/wave)
2. Copy the appropriate template file NOW
3. Start filling in the plan sections immediately
4. Check TodoWrite for any pending planning tasks
5. Begin populating placeholders without delay

**FORBIDDEN - AUTOMATIC FAILURE:**
- ‚ùå "STATE TRANSITION COMPLETE: Now in PLANNING" [stops]
- ‚ùå "Successfully entered PLANNING state" [waits]
- ‚ùå "Ready to create plans" [pauses]
- ‚ùå "I'm in PLANNING state" [does nothing]

**REQUIRED - IMMEDIATE ACTION:**
- ‚úÖ "Entering PLANNING, copying master template now..."
- ‚úÖ "Planning Phase 2, loading phase template..."
- ‚úÖ "PLANNING: Creating wave structure for Phase ${PHASE}..."

## üî¥üî¥üî¥ MANDATORY MEASUREMENT RULE - R304 üî¥üî¥üî¥

### R304: Mandatory Line Counter Tool Enforcement
**File**: `$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/rule-library/R304-mandatory-line-counter-enforcement.md`
**Criticality**: BLOCKING - Manual counting = AUTOMATIC -100% FAILURE

**ABSOLUTE REQUIREMENTS:**
- ‚úÖ MUST use `$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/tools/line-counter.sh` for ALL line counting
- ‚ùå NEVER use `wc -l` or any manual counting method
- ‚ùå NEVER count lines any other way - this is a -100% automatic failure
- ‚úÖ MUST specify both -b (base branch) and -c (current branch) parameters
- ‚úÖ Base branch MUST be phase integration branch (NOT "main")

**Failure to use the line counter tool = AUTOMATIC -100% GRADE**

## State Context
You are creating or reviewing implementation plans at various levels (master, phase, wave) - START IMMEDIATELY!

## Planning Protocol

### Template Locations:
- **Master Plan**: `templates/MASTER-IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN.md`
- **Phase Plan**: `templates/PHASE-IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN.md`  
- **Effort Plan**: `templates/EFFORT-PLANNING-TEMPLATE.md`
- **Work Log**: `templates/WORK-LOG-TEMPLATE.md`

### Planning Workflow:
1. Determine planning level (master/phase/wave/effort)
2. Copy appropriate template to target location
3. Fill in all placeholders with actual values
4. Validate completeness before proceeding
5. Transition to appropriate next state

## Planning Examples

### Example: Starting New Project
```bash
# Orchestrator in PLANNING state for new project

1. Copy master template:
   cp templates/MASTER-IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN.md ./IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN.md

2. Fill in project details:
   - Replace [PROJECT_NAME] with actual name
   - Define 5 phases with targets
   - Estimate total lines and efforts

3. Create phase plans:
   for i in {1..5}; do
     cp templates/PHASE-IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN.md phase-plans/PHASE-$i-PLAN.md
   done

4. Transition to WAVE_START when ready
```

### Example: Planning a Phase
```bash
# Orchestrator planning Phase 2

1. Load phase template:
   cp templates/PHASE-IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN.md phase-plans/PHASE-2-PLAN.md

2. Define waves (typically 3-5):
   - Wave 1: Core Business Logic
   - Wave 2: API Implementation  
   - Wave 3: Data Layer

3. Define efforts per wave:
   - E2.1.1: User Service (600 lines)
   - E2.1.2: Auth Service (500 lines)
   - E2.1.3: Session Management (400 lines)

4. Spawn Code Reviewer for each effort plan
```

## State Transitions

From PLANNING state:
- **PLAN_COMPLETE** ‚Üí WAVE_START (Begin wave execution)
- **SPAWN_REVIEWER** ‚Üí SPAWN_AGENTS (Spawn Code Reviewer for effort plans)

## R322 VIOLATION DETECTION

If you find yourself:
- Starting work for a new state without /continue-orchestrating
- Transitioning without stopping after state file commit
- Continuing after completing state work

**STOP IMMEDIATELY - You are violating R322!**
