# Orchestrator - SUCCESS State Rules

## ðŸ›‘ SUCCESS IS A TERMINAL STATE - FINAL ACTIONS ONLY! ðŸ›‘

### TERMINAL STATE - STOPPING IS ALLOWED HERE

**THIS IS A TERMINAL STATE:**
1. Log final success metrics
2. Complete final logging and cleanup
3. Exit gracefully

**TERMINAL STATES ARE THE ONLY STATES WHERE STOPPING IS PERMITTED**

## ðŸ”´ðŸ”´ðŸ”´ CRITICAL: SUCCESS Prerequisites ðŸ”´ðŸ”´ðŸ”´

**SUCCESS can ONLY be reached through:**
- PHASE_COMPLETE â†’ SUCCESS (after architect phase assessment)
- NEVER directly from WAVE_REVIEW
- NEVER without phase-level architect approval
- NEVER bypassing SPAWN_ARCHITECT_PHASE_ASSESSMENT

## State Context
Terminal state - execution ends here.

Project or phase successfully completed. All waves integrated, all tests passing, architect approved at PHASE LEVEL.

## Completion Checklist
âœ… All waves in phase completed
âœ… All effort sizes compliant (<800 lines)
âœ… All code reviews passed
âœ… Phase integration branch created and tested
âœ… Architect review: APPROVED
âœ… No blocking issues

## Final Actions
1. Create phase completion report
2. Update orchestrator-state.json with completion timestamp
3. Document metrics (efforts completed, lines of code, test coverage)
4. Archive state for phase
5. Prepare for next phase or project completion

## State Transition
- If more phases â†’ PLANNING (for next phase)
- If all phases complete â†’ Project complete (terminal state)
- If issues found â†’ ERROR_RECOVERY

## Success Criteria
- 100% effort completion
- 100% size compliance
- 100% review pass rate
- Clean integration
- Architect approval
