# Orchestrator - SUCCESS State Rules

## üõëüõëüõë R322 MANDATORY STOP BEFORE STATE TRANSITIONS üõëüõëüõë

**SUPREME LAW - VIOLATION = -100% IMMEDIATE FAILURE**

### YOU MUST STOP AFTER:
1. ‚úÖ Completing all TODOs for this state
2. ‚úÖ Updating orchestrator-state.yaml with new state
3. ‚úÖ Committing and pushing the state file  
4. ‚úÖ Providing work summary

### YOU MUST NOT:
- ‚ùå Continue to the next state automatically
- ‚ùå Start work for the new state
- ‚ùå Spawn agents for the new state
- ‚ùå Assume permission to continue

### STOP PROTOCOL:
```markdown
## üõë STATE TRANSITION CHECKPOINT: CURRENT_STATE ‚Üí NEXT_STATE

### ‚úÖ Current State Work Completed:
- [List completed work]

### üìä Current Status:
- Current State: CURRENT_STATE
- Next State: NEXT_STATE
- TODOs Completed: X/Y
- State Files: Updated and committed ‚úÖ

### ‚è∏Ô∏è STOPPED - Awaiting User Continuation
Ready to transition to NEXT_STATE. Please use /continue-orchestrating.
```

**STOP MEANS STOP - Exit and wait for /continue-orchestrating**

---


## üî¥üî¥üî¥ STOP! STATE RULE READING IS ABSOLUTELY FIRST! üî¥üî¥üî¥

**YOU HAVE ENTERED SUCCESS STATE - YOU MUST READ AND ACKNOWLEDGE ALL STATE RULES BEFORE DOING ANY STATE WORK!**

## üî¥üî¥üî¥ R290 VERIFICATION REQUIREMENT üî¥üî¥üî¥

**R290 ENFORCEMENT: CREATE VERIFICATION MARKER AFTER READING**

After reading and acknowledging all state rules, you MUST create a verification marker:

```bash
# MANDATORY: Create verification marker after reading rules
touch .state_rules_read_orchestrator_SUCCESS
echo "$(date +%s) - Rules read and acknowledged for SUCCESS" > .state_rules_read_orchestrator_SUCCESS
```

**FAILURE TO CREATE MARKER = AUTOMATIC -100% PENALTY**

The system will check for this marker. No marker = Immediate failure.

### ‚ùå DO NOT DO ANY SUCCESS WORK UNTIL RULES ARE READ:
- ‚ùå Start finalize all work
- ‚ùå Start generate reports
- ‚ùå Start clean up resources
- ‚ùå Update state files
- ‚ùå Continue to next state
- ‚ùå Think about what to do in this state

### ‚úÖ YOU MUST IMMEDIATELY:

## üî¥üî¥üî¥ MANDATORY STATE RULE READING AND ACKNOWLEDGMENT üî¥üî¥üî¥

### ‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è YOU MUST READ EACH RULE FILE LISTED IN PRIMARY DIRECTIVES. **I AM WATCHING YOUR TOOL CALLS FOR READ OPERATIONS** *YOU WILL FAIL* IF YOU DO NOT MAKE A READ FILE CALL FOR EACH RULE FILE IN PRIMARY DIRECTIVES!!! ‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è

**AFTER READING, YOU MUST ACKNOWLEDGE ALL THE STATE RULES AND STATE THAT YOU WILL ABIDE BY THEM ONE AT A TIME GIVING THE RULE NUMBER AND DESCRIPTION.**

### ‚ùå ANTI-PATTERNS THAT WILL CAUSE FAILURE:

1. **Fake Acknowledgment Without Reading**:
   ```
   ‚ùå WRONG: "I acknowledge R151, R208, R053..."
   (No Read tool calls detected = AUTOMATIC FAILURE)
   ```

2. **Bulk Acknowledgment**:
   ```
   ‚ùå WRONG: "I acknowledge all SUCCESS rules"
   (YOU Must READ AND ACKNOWLEDGE EACH rule individually)
   ```

3. **Silent Reading**:
   ```
   ‚ùå WRONG: [Reads rules but doesn't acknowledge]
   "Now I've read the rules, let me start work..."
   (MUST explicitly acknowledge EACH rule)
   ```

4. **Reading From Memory**:
   ```
   ‚ùå WRONG: "I know R208 requires CD before spawn..."
   (Must READ from file, not recall from memory)
   ```

5. **Skipping Rules in PRIMARY DIRECTIVES**:
   ```
   ‚ùå WRONG: Reading only some rules from the list
   (ALL rules in PRIMARY DIRECTIVES are MANDATORY)
   ```

### ‚úÖ CORRECT PATTERN FOR SUCCESS:
```
1. READ: $CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/rule-library/[first-rule-file].md
2. "I acknowledge [Rule#] - [Rule Name]: [Brief description]"
3. READ: $CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/rule-library/[second-rule-file].md  
4. "I acknowledge [Rule#] - [Rule Name]: [Brief description]"
[Continue for EVERY rule in PRIMARY DIRECTIVES...]
5. "Ready to execute SUCCESS work"
```

### üö® NO WORK UNTIL ACKNOWLEDGMENT COMPLETE üö®
**You may NOT begin ANY SUCCESS work until:**
1. ‚úÖ ALL rules in PRIMARY DIRECTIVES have been READ
2. ‚úÖ ALL rules have been individually ACKNOWLEDGED
3. ‚úÖ You have stated readiness to execute SUCCESS work
1. **READ** every rule file listed in PRIMARY DIRECTIVES below
2. **ACKNOWLEDGE** each rule individually with number and description
3. **ONLY THEN** proceed with SUCCESS work

### üö® FAILURE TO READ STATE RULES FIRST = IMMEDIATE EXIT üö®
**If you do ANY SUCCESS work before reading and acknowledging rules:**
- **STOP ALL WORK IMMEDIATELY**
- **EXIT WITH FAILURE STATUS**
- **YOU HAVE VIOLATED STATE COMPLIANCE**

**THE SYSTEM IS MONITORING YOUR READ TOOL CALLS!**

## üõë SUCCESS IS A TERMINAL STATE - FINAL ACTIONS ONLY! üõë

### TERMINAL STATE - STOPPING IS ALLOWED HERE

**THIS IS A TERMINAL STATE:**
1. Log final success metrics
2. Complete final logging and cleanup
3. Exit gracefully

**TERMINAL STATES ARE THE ONLY STATES WHERE STOPPING IS PERMITTED**

## üî¥üî¥üî¥ CRITICAL: SUCCESS Prerequisites üî¥üî¥üî¥

**SUCCESS can ONLY be reached through:**
- PHASE_COMPLETE ‚Üí SUCCESS (after architect phase assessment)
- NEVER directly from WAVE_REVIEW
- NEVER without phase-level architect approval
- NEVER bypassing SPAWN_ARCHITECT_PHASE_ASSESSMENT
- **üö® R323: NEVER without final artifact built and verified**

## üî¥üî¥üî¥ MANDATORY MEASUREMENT RULE - R304 üî¥üî¥üî¥

**ABSOLUTE REQUIREMENTS:**
- ‚úÖ MUST use `$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/tools/line-counter.sh` for ALL line counting
- ‚ùå NEVER use `wc -l` or any manual counting method
- ‚ùå NEVER count lines any other way - this is a -100% automatic failure
- ‚úÖ MUST specify both -b (base branch) and -c (current branch) parameters
- ‚úÖ Base branch MUST be phase integration branch (NOT "main")

**Failure to use the line counter tool = AUTOMATIC -100% GRADE**

## State Context
Terminal state - execution ends here.

Project or phase successfully completed. All waves integrated, all tests passing, architect approved at PHASE LEVEL.

## üö®üö®üö® RULE R323 - Mandatory Final Artifact Build [BLOCKING]
**Source:** `$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/rule-library/R323-mandatory-final-artifact-build.md`
**Criticality:** BLOCKING - No artifact = -50% to -100% FAILURE

READ THIS RULE FILE: `$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/rule-library/R323-mandatory-final-artifact-build.md`

**‚ö†Ô∏è R323 ENFORCEMENT FOR SUCCESS STATE:**
- CANNOT reach SUCCESS without final artifact built
- MUST have artifact path documented in state file
- MUST have artifact verified and tested
- MUST document artifact size and type

## Completion Checklist
‚úÖ All waves in phase completed
‚úÖ All effort sizes compliant (<800 lines)
‚úÖ All code reviews passed
‚úÖ Phase integration branch created and tested
‚úÖ Architect review: APPROVED
‚úÖ No blocking issues
‚úÖ **R323: Final artifact built and verified**
‚úÖ **R323: Artifact location documented**

## Final Actions
1. Create phase completion report
2. Update orchestrator-state.yaml with completion timestamp
3. Document metrics (efforts completed, lines of code, test coverage)
4. **R323: Document final artifact details (path, size, type, build command)**
5. Archive state for phase
6. Prepare for next phase or project completion

## State Transition
- If more phases ‚Üí PLANNING (for next phase)
- If all phases complete ‚Üí Project complete (terminal state)
- If issues found ‚Üí ERROR_RECOVERY

## Success Criteria
- 100% effort completion
- 100% size compliance
- 100% review pass rate
- Clean integration
- Architect approval

## R322 VIOLATION DETECTION

If you find yourself:
- Starting work for a new state without /continue-orchestrating
- Transitioning without stopping after state file commit
- Continuing after completing state work

**STOP IMMEDIATELY - You are violating R322!**
