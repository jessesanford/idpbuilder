# Integration Agent - COMPLETED State Rules

## State Definition
The COMPLETED state indicates successful completion of all integration tasks.

## Final Validation

### 1. Self-Assessment
```bash
echo "=== INTEGRATION COMPLETE ==="
echo "Integration Branch: $INTEGRATION_BRANCH"
echo "Branches Integrated: ${#MERGED_BRANCHES[@]}"
echo "Conflicts Resolved: $CONFLICT_COUNT"
echo "Documentation Complete: YES"
```

### 2. Grading Self-Evaluation
Review against R267 criteria:
- Completeness of Integration (50%)
  - Branch merging: ___/20%
  - Conflict resolution: ___/15%
  - Branch integrity: ___/10%
  - Final validation: ___/5%
- Documentation Quality (50%)
  - Work log: ___/25%
  - Integration report: ___/25%

### 3. Final Verification
```bash
# Verify no violations
git log --grep="cherry picked" && echo "‚ùå VIOLATION" || echo "‚úÖ No cherry-picks"

# Check documentation
for doc in INTEGRATION-PLAN.md work-log.md INTEGRATION-REPORT.md; do
    [[ -f "$doc" ]] && echo "‚úÖ $doc exists" || echo "‚ùå Missing $doc"
done
```

## Success Indicators
