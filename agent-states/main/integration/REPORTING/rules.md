# Integration Agent - REPORTING State Rules

## State Definition
The REPORTING state completes all documentation and prepares final deliverables.

## Required Actions

### 1. Complete INTEGRATION-REPORT.md
Must include ALL sections:
- Overview (branches integrated, statistics)
- Errors and Issues Found
- Compensating/Remediation Recommendations  
- Build and Test Results
- Upstream Bugs Identified
- Integration Verification Checklist
- Final State

### 2. Verify Work Log Completeness
```bash
# Ensure work-log is replayable
grep "^Command:" work-log.md > replay.sh
bash -n replay.sh  # Verify syntax

# Count operations
OPERATION_COUNT=$(grep -c "^## Operation" work-log.md)
echo "Total operations documented: $OPERATION_COUNT"
```

### 3. Commit Documentation
```bash
# Add all documentation to integration branch
git add INTEGRATION-PLAN.md work-log.md INTEGRATION-REPORT.md
git commit -m "docs: complete integration documentation for [branch list]"
git push origin "$INTEGRATION_BRANCH"
```

## üî¥üî¥üî¥ MANDATORY MEASUREMENT RULE - R304 üî¥üî¥üî¥

### R304: Mandatory Line Counter Tool Enforcement
**File**: `$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/rule-library/R304-mandatory-line-counter-enforcement.md`
**Criticality**: BLOCKING - Manual counting = AUTOMATIC -100% FAILURE

**ABSOLUTE REQUIREMENTS:**
- ‚úÖ MUST use `$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/tools/line-counter.sh` for ALL line counting
- ‚ùå NEVER use `wc -l` or any manual counting method
- ‚ùå NEVER count lines any other way - this is a -100% automatic failure
- ‚úÖ MUST specify both -b (base branch) and -c (current branch) parameters
- ‚úÖ Base branch MUST be phase integration branch (NOT "main")

**Failure to use the line counter tool = AUTOMATIC -100% GRADE**
