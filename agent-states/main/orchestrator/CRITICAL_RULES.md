# ðŸš¨ DEPRECATED - DO NOT USE ðŸš¨

**This file was deprecated on 2025-09-01**

## Why This File Was Deprecated

This file contained massive duplication with rules already present in:
- `.claude/agents/orchestrator.md` (supreme laws)
- State-specific rule files in `agent-states/orchestrator/[STATE]/rules.md`

The duplication was causing:
- Confusion about which rules to follow
- Unnecessary reading overhead (862 lines of mostly duplicate content)
- Risk of rules getting out of sync
- Violation of single source of truth principle

## Where The Rules Moved To

All rules have been redistributed to their proper locations:

### Supreme Laws
Now exclusively in `.claude/agents/orchestrator.md`:
- R234 - Mandatory State Traversal (HIGHEST SUPREME LAW)

- R221 - Bash Directory Reset Protocol (SUPREME LAW #4)
- R235 - Mandatory Pre-flight Verification (SUPREME LAW #5)
- R322 - Mandatory Stop Before State Transitions (SUPREME LAW #8)
- R322 - Continuous Operation (SUPREME LAW #9)
- R232 - TodoWrite Enforcement (SUPREME LAW #10)
- R281 - Complete State File Initialization (SUPREME LAW #7)
- R288 - State File Update and Commit Protocol (SUPREME LAW)
