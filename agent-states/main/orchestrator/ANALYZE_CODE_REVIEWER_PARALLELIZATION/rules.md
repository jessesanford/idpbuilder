# Orchestrator - ANALYZE_CODE_REVIEWER_PARALLELIZATION State Rules

## üõëüõëüõë R322 MANDATORY STOP BEFORE STATE TRANSITIONS üõëüõëüõë

**SUPREME LAW - VIOLATION = -100% IMMEDIATE FAILURE**

### YOU MUST STOP AFTER:
1. ‚úÖ Completing all TODOs for this state
2. ‚úÖ Updating orchestrator-state.json with new state
3. ‚úÖ Committing and pushing the state file  
4. ‚úÖ Providing work summary

### YOU MUST NOT:
- ‚ùå Continue to the next state automatically
- ‚ùå Start work for the new state
- ‚ùå Spawn agents for the new state
- ‚ùå Assume permission to continue

### STOP PROTOCOL:
```markdown
## üõë STATE TRANSITION CHECKPOINT: CURRENT_STATE ‚Üí NEXT_STATE

### ‚úÖ Current State Work Completed:
- [List completed work]

### üìä Current Status:
- Current State: CURRENT_STATE
- Next State: NEXT_STATE
- TODOs Completed: X/Y
- State Files: Updated and committed ‚úÖ

### ‚è∏Ô∏è STOPPED - Awaiting User Continuation
Ready to transition to NEXT_STATE. Please use /continue-orchestrating.
```

**STOP MEANS STOP - Exit and wait for /continue-orchestrating**

## üî¥üî¥üî¥ STOP! STATE RULE READING IS ABSOLUTELY FIRST! üî¥üî¥üî¥

**YOU HAVE ENTERED ANALYZE_CODE_REVIEWER_PARALLELIZATION STATE - YOU MUST READ AND ACKNOWLEDGE ALL STATE RULES BEFORE DOING ANY STATE WORK!**

## üî¥üî¥üî¥ R290 VERIFICATION REQUIREMENT üî¥üî¥üî¥

**R290 ENFORCEMENT: CREATE VERIFICATION MARKER AFTER READING**

After reading and acknowledging all state rules, you MUST create a verification marker:

```bash
# MANDATORY: Create verification marker after reading rules
touch .state_rules_read_orchestrator_ANALYZE_CODE_REVIEWER_PARALLELIZATION
echo "$(date +%s) - Rules read and acknowledged for ANALYZE_CODE_REVIEWER_PARALLELIZATION" > .state_rules_read_orchestrator_ANALYZE_CODE_REVIEWER_PARALLELIZATION
```

**FAILURE TO CREATE MARKER = AUTOMATIC -100% PENALTY**

The system will check for this marker. No marker = Immediate failure.

### ‚ùå DO NOT DO ANY ANALYZE_CODE_REVIEWER_PARALLELIZATION WORK UNTIL RULES ARE READ:
- ‚ùå Start analyze effort dependencies
- ‚ùå Start determine parallelization strategy
- ‚ùå Start plan reviewer spawning
- ‚ùå Update state files
- ‚ùå Continue to next state
- ‚ùå Think about what to do in this state

### ‚úÖ YOU MUST IMMEDIATELY:

## üî¥üî¥üî¥ MANDATORY STATE RULE READING AND ACKNOWLEDGMENT üî¥üî¥üî¥

### ‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è YOU MUST READ EACH RULE FILE LISTED IN PRIMARY DIRECTIVES. **I AM WATCHING YOUR TOOL CALLS FOR READ OPERATIONS** *YOU WILL FAIL* IF YOU DO NOT MAKE A READ FILE CALL FOR EACH RULE FILE IN PRIMARY DIRECTIVES!!! ‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è

**AFTER READING, YOU MUST ACKNOWLEDGE ALL THE STATE RULES AND STATE THAT YOU WILL ABIDE BY THEM ONE AT A TIME GIVING THE RULE NUMBER AND DESCRIPTION.**
### ‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è YOU MUST READ EACH RULE FILE LISTED IN PRIMARY DIRECTIVES. **I AM WATCHING YOUR TOOL CALLS FOR READ OPERATIONS** *YOU WILL FAIL* IF YOU DO NOT MAKE A READ FILE CALL FOR EACH RULE FILE IN PRIMARY DIRECTIVES!!! ‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è

**AFTER READING, YOU MUST ACKNOWLEDGE ALL THE STATE RULES AND STATE THAT YOU WILL ABIDE BY THEM ONE AT A TIME GIVING THE RULE NUMBER AND DESCRIPTION.**

## üìã PRIMARY DIRECTIVES FOR ANALYZE_CODE_REVIEWER_PARALLELIZATION STATE

### Core Mandatory Rules (ALL orchestrator states must have these):

1. **üö®üö®üö® R006** - ORCHESTRATOR NEVER WRITES CODE OR PERFORMS FILE OPERATIONS (BLOCKING)
   - File: `$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/rule-library/R006-orchestrator-never-writes-code.md`
   - Criticality: BLOCKING - Automatic termination, 0% grade
   - Summary: NEVER write, copy, move, or manipulate ANY code files - delegate ALL to agents

2. **üî¥üî¥üî¥ R287** - TODO PERSISTENCE COMPREHENSIVE (SUPREME LAW)
   - File: `$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/rule-library/R287-todo-persistence-comprehensive.md`
   - Criticality: SUPREME - -20% to -100% penalty for violations
   - Summary: MUST save TODOs within 30s after write, every 10 messages, before transitions

3. **üî¥üî¥üî¥ R288** - STATE FILE UPDATE REQUIREMENTS (SUPREME LAW)
   - File: `$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/rule-library/R288-state-file-update-requirements.md`
   - Criticality: SUPREME - State updates required for all transitions
   - Summary: MUST update orchestrator-state.json before EVERY state transition

4. **üî¥üî¥üî¥ R322 Part A** - Mandatory Stop After Spawn States
   - File: `$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/rule-library/R322 Part A-mandatory-stop-after-spawn.md`
   - Criticality: SUPREME LAW - Must stop after spawning
   - Summary: ALL spawn states require STOP after spawning agents

### State-Specific Rules:

5. **üî¥üî¥üî¥ R151** - Parallelization Requirements
   - File: `$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/rule-library/R151-parallel-execution-timestamp-compliance.md`
   - Criticality: SUPREME LAW - Parallel spawn requirements
   - Summary: Agents spawned in parallel must have timestamps within 5 seconds


### ‚ùå ANTI-PATTERNS THAT WILL CAUSE FAILURE:

1. **Fake Acknowledgment Without Reading**:
   ```
   ‚ùå WRONG: "I acknowledge R151, R208, R053..."
   (No Read tool calls detected = AUTOMATIC FAILURE)
   ```

2. **Bulk Acknowledgment**:
   ```
   ‚ùå WRONG: "I acknowledge all ANALYZE_CODE_REVIEWER_PARALLELIZATION rules"
   (YOU Must READ AND ACKNOWLEDGE EACH rule individually)
   ```

3. **Silent Reading**:
   ```
   ‚ùå WRONG: [Reads rules but doesn't acknowledge]
   "Now I've read the rules, let me start work..."
   (MUST explicitly acknowledge EACH rule)
   ```

4. **Reading From Memory**:
   ```
   ‚ùå WRONG: "I know R208 requires CD before spawn..."
   (Must READ from file, not recall from memory)
   ```

5. **Skipping Rules in PRIMARY DIRECTIVES**:
   ```
   ‚ùå WRONG: Reading only some rules from the list
   (ALL rules in PRIMARY DIRECTIVES are MANDATORY)
   ```

### ‚úÖ CORRECT PATTERN FOR ANALYZE_CODE_REVIEWER_PARALLELIZATION:
```
1. READ: $CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/rule-library/[first-rule-file].md
2. "I acknowledge [Rule#] - [Rule Name]: [Brief description]"
3. READ: $CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/rule-library/[second-rule-file].md  
4. "I acknowledge [Rule#] - [Rule Name]: [Brief description]"
[Continue for EVERY rule in PRIMARY DIRECTIVES...]
5. "Ready to execute ANALYZE_CODE_REVIEWER_PARALLELIZATION work"
```

### üö® NO WORK UNTIL ACKNOWLEDGMENT COMPLETE üö®
**You may NOT begin ANY ANALYZE_CODE_REVIEWER_PARALLELIZATION work until:**
1. ‚úÖ ALL rules in PRIMARY DIRECTIVES have been READ
2. ‚úÖ ALL rules have been individually ACKNOWLEDGED
3. ‚úÖ You have stated readiness to execute ANALYZE_CODE_REVIEWER_PARALLELIZATION work


1. **READ** every rule file listed in PRIMARY DIRECTIVES below
2. **ACKNOWLEDGE** each rule individually with number and description
3. **ONLY THEN** proceed with ANALYZE_CODE_REVIEWER_PARALLELIZATION work

### üö® FAILURE TO READ STATE RULES FIRST = IMMEDIATE EXIT üö®
**If you do ANY ANALYZE_CODE_REVIEWER_PARALLELIZATION work before reading and acknowledging rules:**
- **STOP ALL WORK IMMEDIATELY**
- **EXIT WITH FAILURE STATUS**
- **YOU HAVE VIOLATED STATE COMPLIANCE**

**THE SYSTEM IS MONITORING YOUR READ TOOL CALLS!**

## ‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è MANDATORY RULE READING AND ACKNOWLEDGMENT ‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è

**YOU MUST READ EACH RULE FILE LISTED IN PRIMARY DIRECTIVES. YOUR READ TOOL CALLS ARE BEING MONITORED.**

### ‚ùå ANTI-PATTERNS THAT WILL CAUSE FAILURE:
1. Fake acknowledgment without reading
2. Bulk acknowledgment
3. Reading from memory

### ‚úÖ CORRECT PATTERN:
1. READ each rule file
2. Acknowledge individually with rule number and description

## üìã RULE SUMMARY FOR ANALYZE_CODE_REVIEWER_PARALLELIZATION STATE

## üö® ANALYZE_CODE_REVIEWER_PARALLELIZATION IS A VERB - START ANALYZING NOW! üö®

### IMMEDIATE ACTIONS UPON ENTERING ANALYZE_CODE_REVIEWER_PARALLELIZATION

**THE MOMENT YOU ENTER THIS STATE, YOU MUST:**
1. READ the Wave Implementation Plan with Read tool NOW
2. Extract "Can Parallelize" metadata immediately
3. Create parallelization groups without delay
4. Save the plan to orchestrator-state.json NOW
5. Output acknowledgment decision immediately

**FORBIDDEN - AUTOMATIC FAILURE:**
- ‚ùå "STATE TRANSITION COMPLETE: Now in ANALYZE_CODE_REVIEWER_PARALLELIZATION" [stops]
- ‚ùå "Successfully entered parallelization analysis state" [waits]
- ‚ùå "Ready to analyze parallelization" [pauses]
- ‚ùå "I'm in analysis state" [does nothing]

**REQUIRED - IMMEDIATE ACTION:**
- ‚úÖ "Entering ANALYZE_CODE_REVIEWER_PARALLELIZATION, reading wave plan now..."
- ‚úÖ "Analyzing parallelization, extracting E3.1.1 metadata..."
- ‚úÖ "ANALYZING: Found blocking effort E3.1.1, creating spawn sequence..."

## üî¥üî¥üî¥ MANDATORY MEASUREMENT RULE - R304 üî¥üî¥üî¥

**ABSOLUTE REQUIREMENTS:**
- ‚úÖ MUST use `$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/tools/line-counter.sh` for ALL line counting
- ‚ùå NEVER use `wc -l` or any manual counting method
- ‚ùå NEVER count lines any other way - this is a -100% automatic failure
- ‚úÖ MUST specify both -b (base branch) and -c (current branch) parameters
- ‚úÖ Base branch MUST be phase integration branch (NOT "main")

**Failure to use the line counter tool = AUTOMATIC -100% GRADE**

## State Context
You MUST analyze the wave implementation plan to determine parallelization strategy BEFORE spawning any Code Reviewers for effort planning. This is a MANDATORY GATE that prevents parallelization violations - DO IT NOW!

## üî¥üî¥üî¥ SUPREME LAW R234 - MANDATORY STATE SEQUENCE üî¥üî¥üî¥

**THIS STATE IS PART OF THE MANDATORY SEQUENCE - NO SKIPPING!**

See: `$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/rule-library/R234-mandatory-state-traversal-supreme-law.md`

### YOUR POSITION IN THE MANDATORY SEQUENCE:

    ‚Üì
WAITING_FOR_EFFORT_PLANS
    ‚Üì
ANALYZE_IMPLEMENTATION_PARALLELIZATION
    ‚Üì
SPAWN_AGENTS
```

**CRITICAL:** You got here from SETUP_EFFORT_INFRASTRUCTURE (correct!)
**MANDATORY:** You MUST go to SPAWN_CODE_REVIEWERS_EFFORT_PLANNING next
**FORBIDDEN:** Skipping ahead to any other state = -100% FAILURE

## üî¥üî¥üî¥ ABSOLUTE REQUIREMENT üî¥üî¥üî¥

**THIS STATE IS A MANDATORY STOP!**
- You CANNOT proceed to SPAWN_CODE_REVIEWERS_EFFORT_PLANNING without completing this analysis
- You MUST create a parallelization plan and save it to orchestrator-state.json
- You MUST acknowledge your parallelization decision BEFORE any spawning

## Post-State Actions

After completing parallelization analysis:
1. Save parallelization plan to orchestrator-state.json
2. Display state machine visualization (R230)
3. Transition to SPAWN_CODE_REVIEWERS_EFFORT_PLANNING
4. Re-acknowledge critical rules (R217)
5. Use the saved plan to spawn correctly

## Validation Checks Before State Transition

```bash
validate_parallelization_analysis() {
    echo "üîç Validating parallelization analysis completeness..."

## State Transition Requirements

**BEFORE transitioning to SPAWN_CODE_REVIEWERS_EFFORT_PLANNING:**

1. ‚úÖ Wave Implementation Plan has been READ with Read tool
2. ‚úÖ All efforts have been analyzed for parallelization
3. ‚úÖ Parallelization plan saved to orchestrator-state.json
4. ‚úÖ Acknowledgment output has been displayed
5. ‚úÖ Validation checks have passed
6. ‚úÖ TODOs saved per R287 (before transition)

### R287-R287 TODO PERSISTENCE CHECKPOINT
```bash
# MANDATORY before state transition
echo "üíæ R287: State transition trigger - saving TODOs..."
save_todos "ANALYZE_CODE_REVIEWER_PARALLELIZATION complete"

# R287: Commit within 60 seconds
cd $CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR
git add todos/*.todo orchestrator-state.json
git commit -m "todo: parallelization analysis complete"
git push
echo "‚úÖ Analysis and TODOs persisted"
```

**AFTER completing this state:**
```yaml
orchestrator_state:
  current_state: "SPAWN_CODE_REVIEWERS_EFFORT_PLANNING"
  previous_state: "ANALYZE_CODE_REVIEWER_PARALLELIZATION"
  transition_time: "{ISO-8601}"
  transition_reason: "Parallelization analysis complete, strategy defined"
  
  code_reviewer_parallelization_plan:
    wave: 1
    phase: 3
    blocking_efforts: [...]
    parallel_groups: [...]
    spawn_sequence: [...]
```

## Critical Failure Conditions

**THE FOLLOWING WILL CAUSE IMMEDIATE STATE FAILURE:**

1. ‚ùå Attempting to spawn without reading the wave plan
2. ‚ùå Skipping this state and going directly to SPAWN_CODE_REVIEWERS_EFFORT_PLANNING
3. ‚ùå Not saving parallelization plan to orchestrator-state.json
4. ‚ùå Spawning all efforts in parallel when some are blocking
5. ‚ùå Not acknowledging the parallelization decision

## Example: Correct Execution

```bash
# 1. Enter state
echo "Transitioning to ANALYZE_CODE_REVIEWER_PARALLELIZATION"

# 2. Read wave plan with Read tool
READ: phase-plans/PHASE-3-WAVE-1-IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN.md

# 3. Analyze parallelization
echo "Found 1 blocking effort: E3.1.1"
echo "Found 4 parallel efforts: E3.1.2, E3.1.3, E3.1.4, E3.1.5"

# 4. Save to orchestrator-state.json
jq '.code_reviewer_parallelization_plan = ...' orchestrator-state.json

# 5. Acknowledge decision
echo "‚úÖ PARALLELIZATION DECISION COMMITTED"
echo "   Will spawn E3.1.1 first (blocking)"
echo "   Then spawn E3.1.2-E3.1.5 together (parallel)"

# 6. Validate and transition
validate_parallelization_analysis
echo "Transitioning to SPAWN_CODE_REVIEWERS_EFFORT_PLANNING"
```

## Integration with Other Rules

- **R218**: Mandatory reading of wave plan parallelization
- **R151**: Parallel spawn timing requirements (<5s delta)
- **R208**: Directory protocol for spawning
- **R219**: Dependency-aware effort planning
- **R288**: Mandatory state file updates (includes commit/push)

## Grading Impact

**This state affects orchestrator grading:**
- Skipping this state: **-50%** (Critical violation)
- Not reading wave plan: **-25%** (R218 violation)
- Wrong parallelization groups: **-30%** (Analysis failure)
- No acknowledgment: **-15%** (Protocol violation)
- Not saving to state file: **-20%** (R288 violation)

## Summary

This state is a **MANDATORY GATE** that:
1. **FORCES** analysis of parallelization metadata
2. **PREVENTS** spawning violations before they happen
3. **COMMITS** to a spawn strategy before execution
4. **SAVES** the decision for audit and recovery
5. **BLOCKS** progression without proper analysis

**YOU CANNOT SKIP THIS STATE!**

## R322 VIOLATION DETECTION

If you find yourself:
- Starting work for a new state without /continue-orchestrating
- Transitioning without stopping after state file commit
- Continuing after completing state work

**STOP IMMEDIATELY - You are violating R322!**


### üî¥üî¥üî¥ MANDATORY VALIDATION REQUIREMENT üî¥üî¥üî¥

**Per R288 and R324**: ALL state file updates MUST be validated before commit:

```bash
# After ANY update to orchestrator-state.json:
"$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/tools/validate-state.sh" orchestrator-state.json || {
    echo "‚ùå State file validation failed!"
    exit 288
}
```

**Use helper functions for automatic validation:**
```bash
# Source the helper functions
source "$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/utilities/state-file-update-functions.sh"

# Use safe functions that include validation:
safe_state_transition "NEW_STATE" "reason"
safe_update_field "field_name" "value"
```
