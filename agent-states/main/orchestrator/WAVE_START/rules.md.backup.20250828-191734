# Orchestrator - WAVE_START State Rules

## üö® WAVE_START IS A VERB - START THE WAVE IMMEDIATELY! üö®

### IMMEDIATE ACTIONS UPON ENTERING WAVE_START

**THE MOMENT YOU ENTER THIS STATE, YOU MUST:**
1. Initialize wave infrastructure NOW (directories, branches)
2. Load wave implementation plan immediately
3. Check TodoWrite for pending wave setup tasks
4. Verify all effort planning is complete
5. Transition to next state based on readiness

**FORBIDDEN - AUTOMATIC FAILURE:**
- ‚ùå "STATE TRANSITION COMPLETE: Now in WAVE_START" [stops]
- ‚ùå "Successfully entered WAVE_START state" [waits]
- ‚ùå "Ready to start wave" [pauses]
- ‚ùå "I'm in WAVE_START state" [does nothing]

**REQUIRED - IMMEDIATE ACTION:**
- ‚úÖ "Entering WAVE_START, creating wave ${WAVE} infrastructure now..."
- ‚úÖ "Starting Wave ${WAVE}, checking effort plans..."
- ‚úÖ "WAVE_START: Initializing directories for ${EFFORT_COUNT} efforts..."

## State Context
Beginning a new wave of implementation. Must set up all infrastructure and verify readiness before spawning agents.

## Primary Actions (DO IMMEDIATELY!)
1. Create wave directory structure
2. Initialize effort branches
3. Verify all effort plans exist
4. Check agent availability
5. Determine parallelization strategy
6. Transition to appropriate next state

## Critical Validations
- All effort implementation plans must exist
- All effort directories must be created
- All branches must be initialized
- Agent pool must be sufficient

## State Transitions
- If plans missing ‚Üí SPAWN_CODE_REVIEWERS_EFFORT_PLANNING
- If infrastructure needed ‚Üí SETUP_EFFORT_INFRASTRUCTURE
- If ready to spawn ‚Üí ANALYZE_CODE_REVIEWER_PARALLELIZATION
- If error ‚Üí ERROR_RECOVERY

## Immediate Action Examples
```bash
# CORRECT - Immediate action:
echo "Entering WAVE_START for Phase ${PHASE} Wave ${WAVE}"
mkdir -p phase${PHASE}/wave${WAVE}
for effort in E3.1.1 E3.1.2 E3.1.3; do
    mkdir -p efforts/${effort}
    echo "Created ${effort} directory"
done

# WRONG - Passive waiting:
echo "Now in WAVE_START state"
echo "Ready to begin wave"
# [waits for something]
```

## Next Steps
Based on what's found during immediate checks, transition to the appropriate state WITHOUT DELAY.
