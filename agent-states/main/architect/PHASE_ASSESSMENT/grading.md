# PHASE_ASSESSMENT Grading Criteria

## ðŸš¨ðŸš¨ðŸš¨ MANDATORY: Phase Assessment Report Required [R257] ðŸš¨ðŸš¨ðŸš¨

**BLOCKING REQUIREMENT**: You MUST create a `PHASE-{N}-ASSESSMENT-REPORT.md` file at `phase-assessments/phase{N}/` with ALL grading results documented. Assessment without this report = AUTOMATIC FAILURE.

## Architecture Quality Metrics

### Primary Assessment Categories

| Category | Weight | Scoring Method | Pass Threshold |
|----------|--------|----------------|----------------|
| KCP Pattern Compliance | 30% | Binary (Pass/Fail) | 100% |
| API Design Quality | 25% | Weighted Checklist | 90% |
| Integration Stability | 20% | Test Results + Manual Review | 95% |
| Performance Benchmarks | 15% | Quantitative Measurements | 85% |
| Security Posture | 10% | Vulnerability Assessment | 100% |

## Detailed Grading Rubric

### KCP Pattern Compliance (30% - Binary Scoring)

| Pattern Area | Requirement | Points |
|--------------|-------------|--------|
| LogicalCluster Fields | All CRDs include proper LogicalCluster metadata | 25 |
| Workspace Isolation | Controllers respect workspace boundaries | 25 |
| Resource Naming | No cross-workspace naming conflicts possible | 20 |
| RBAC Patterns | Proper Role/ClusterRole usage for multi-tenancy | 20 |
| Event Handling | Events scoped to appropriate workspace | 10 |

**Scoring**: Must achieve 100% (100/100 points) to pass
**Failure Impact**: Automatic OFF_TRACK status

### API Design Quality (25% - Weighted Checklist)

| Design Aspect | Weight | Excellent (100%) | Good (75%) | Needs Work (50%) | Poor (0%) |
|---------------|--------|------------------|------------|------------------|-----------|
| Backwards Compatibility | 40% | No breaking changes | Minor deprecations | Some breaking changes | Major breaking changes |
| Schema Completeness | 30% | Full validation, examples | Good validation | Basic validation | Missing validation |
| Documentation | 20% | Complete API docs | Good coverage | Basic docs | Poor/missing docs |
| Consistency | 10% | Perfect alignment | Minor inconsistencies | Some inconsistencies | Major inconsistencies |

**Calculation Example**:
- Backwards Compatibility: 100% Ã— 0.40 = 40 points
- Schema Completeness: 75% Ã— 0.30 = 22.5 points  
- Documentation: 50% Ã— 0.20 = 10 points
- Consistency: 100% Ã— 0.10 = 10 points
- **Total**: 82.5% (Pass - above 90% threshold requires improvement)

### Integration Stability (20% - Test Results + Manual Review)

| Integration Aspect | Points Available | Measurement Method |
|-------------------|------------------|-------------------|
| Wave Merge Success | 40 | All wave branches merge cleanly |
| Cross-component Tests | 30 | Integration test suite passes |
| Dependency Resolution | 20 | No circular or broken dependencies |
| Rollback Capability | 10 | Can safely revert to previous phase |

**Scoring Examples**:
- **Perfect Integration** (100/100): All merges clean, tests pass, dependencies resolved
- **Minor Issues** (85/100): One merge conflict resolved, tests pass with warnings
- **Major Issues** (60/100): Multiple merge conflicts, some integration tests failing

### Performance Benchmarks (15% - Quantitative Measurements)

| Metric | Baseline | Target | Measurement | Score Calculation |
|--------|----------|--------|-------------|------------------|
| API Response Time | 100ms | <150ms | Actual measured | 100% if â‰¤target, linear decrease |
| Resource Usage | 512MB | <768MB | Memory profiling | 100% if â‰¤target, linear decrease |
| Throughput | 1000 req/s | >800 req/s | Load testing | 100% if â‰¥target, linear decrease |
| Startup Time | 30s | <45s | Container metrics | 100% if â‰¤target, linear decrease |

**Scoring Formula**: 
```
Score = MAX(0, MIN(100, 100 Ã— (Target - Actual) / (Target - Baseline)))
```

### Security Posture (10% - Vulnerability Assessment)

| Security Area | Critical | High | Medium | Low | Score Impact |
|---------------|----------|------|--------|-----|--------------|
| Workspace Isolation | 0 | 0 | â‰¤2 | Any | Critical=Fail, High=50% deduction |
| RBAC Violations | 0 | 0 | â‰¤1 | Any | Critical=Fail, High=75% deduction |
| Secret Management | 0 | â‰¤1 | â‰¤3 | Any | Critical=Fail, High=25% deduction |
| Input Validation | 0 | â‰¤2 | â‰¤5 | Any | Critical=Fail, High=10% deduction |

## Overall Grade Calculation

### Final Score Formula
```
Final Score = (KCP_Compliance Ã— 0.30) + (API_Quality Ã— 0.25) + 
              (Integration_Stability Ã— 0.20) + (Performance Ã— 0.15) + 
              (Security Ã— 0.10)
```

### Grade Boundaries and Actions

| Final Score | Grade | Action | Next State |
|-------------|-------|--------|------------|
| 95-100% | ON_TRACK | Approve phase, continue to next | Next Phase Planning |
| 85-94% | NEEDS_CORRECTION | Provide specific improvement list | Return to Orchestrator |
| 70-84% | NEEDS_MAJOR_CORRECTION | Require significant rework | Extended Fix Cycle |
| <70% | OFF_TRACK | Halt progression, redesign required | Architecture Redesign |

### Grade Calculation Examples

#### Example 1: High-Quality Phase
```
KCP Compliance: 100% (Binary Pass)
API Quality: 95% (Excellent design, minor doc gaps)
Integration: 98% (One minor merge conflict)
Performance: 92% (Slightly higher memory usage)
Security: 100% (No vulnerabilities)

Final = (100Ã—0.30) + (95Ã—0.25) + (98Ã—0.20) + (92Ã—0.15) + (100Ã—0.10)
Final = 30 + 23.75 + 19.6 + 13.8 + 10 = 97.15%
Grade = ON_TRACK
```

#### Example 2: Needs Correction
```
KCP Compliance: 100% (Binary Pass)
API Quality: 88% (Good design, some inconsistencies)
Integration: 90% (Multiple merge conflicts resolved)
Performance: 78% (Performance regression identified)
Security: 100% (No vulnerabilities)

Final = (100Ã—0.30) + (88Ã—0.25) + (90Ã—0.20) + (78Ã—0.15) + (100Ã—0.10)
Final = 30 + 22 + 18 + 11.7 + 10 = 91.7%
Grade = NEEDS_CORRECTION
```

#### Example 3: Off Track
```
KCP Compliance: 60% (Missing LogicalCluster in some CRDs)
API Quality: 70% (Breaking changes without migration)
Integration: 85% (Integration tests failing)
Performance: 65% (Significant performance regression)
Security: 40% (Workspace isolation issues)

Final = (60Ã—0.30) + (70Ã—0.25) + (85Ã—0.20) + (65Ã—0.15) + (40Ã—0.10)
Final = 18 + 17.5 + 17 + 9.75 + 4 = 66.25%
Grade = OFF_TRACK
```
