```

## Overall Architecture Grade Calculation

### Final Score Formula
```
Architecture Score = (Consistency × 0.20) + (TechnicalDebt × 0.20) + 
                    (Performance × 0.15) + (Security × 0.15) + 
                    (KCPPatterns × 0.15) + (Operations × 0.10) + 
                    (Evolution × 0.05)
```

### Decision Matrix

| Final Score | Architecture Health | Action Required | Timeline |
|-------------|-------------------|-----------------|----------|
| 90-100% | ARCHITECTURE_HEALTHY | Continue development | None |
| 75-89% | IMPROVEMENTS_REQUIRED | Address identified issues | 2-6 weeks |
| 60-74% | IMPROVEMENTS_REQUIRED | Major improvements needed | 1-3 months |
| <60% | ARCHITECTURE_DEGRADED | Significant refactoring | 3-6 months |

### Critical Failure Override Rules

Regardless of overall score, certain conditions trigger immediate ARCHITECTURE_DEGRADED:

- **Security**: Any critical vulnerabilities or multi-tenancy violations
- **KCP Patterns**: <95% LogicalCluster field compliance
- **Technical Debt**: Any critical-severity debt items
- **Performance**: >30% performance degradation from baseline

### Grade Calculation Examples

#### Example 1: Healthy Architecture
```
Architectural Consistency: 92% (minor pattern variations)
Technical Debt: 85% (low-medium debt, well managed)
Performance: 94% (excellent performance characteristics)
Security: 98% (minor vulnerabilities, excellent posture)
KCP Patterns: 100% (perfect compliance)
Operational Readiness: 88% (good operational capabilities)
Evolution Capability: 90% (good extensibility design)

Final = (92×0.20) + (85×0.20) + (94×0.15) + (98×0.15) + (100×0.15) + (88×0.10) + (90×0.05)
Final = 18.4 + 17 + 14.1 + 14.7 + 15 + 8.8 + 4.5 = 92.5%
Health = ARCHITECTURE_HEALTHY
```

#### Example 2: Improvements Required
```
Architectural Consistency: 78% (notable pattern drift)
Technical Debt: 45% (high debt requiring attention)
Performance: 82% (performance regressions identified)
Security: 75% (multiple high-severity vulnerabilities)
KCP Patterns: 88% (some non-compliance issues)
Operational Readiness: 70% (operational gaps identified)
Evolution Capability: 65% (limited extensibility)

Final = (78×0.20) + (45×0.20) + (82×0.15) + (75×0.15) + (88×0.15) + (70×0.10) + (65×0.05)
Final = 15.6 + 9 + 12.3 + 11.25 + 13.2 + 7 + 3.25 = 71.6%
Health = IMPROVEMENTS_REQUIRED
```

#### Example 3: Architecture Degraded
```
Architectural Consistency: 58% (significant pattern violations)
Technical Debt: 25% (critical debt items present)
Performance: 40% (major performance issues)
Security: 30% (critical vulnerabilities detected)
KCP Patterns: 70% (major compliance failures)
Operational Readiness: 45% (major operational gaps)
Evolution Capability: 40% (inflexible architecture)

Final = (58×0.20) + (25×0.20) + (40×0.15) + (30×0.15) + (70×0.15) + (45×0.10) + (40×0.05)
Final = 11.6 + 5 + 6 + 4.5 + 10.5 + 4.5 + 2 = 44.1%
Health = ARCHITECTURE_DEGRADED

Note: Critical failures in multiple categories would also trigger ARCHITECTURE_DEGRADED regardless of score
