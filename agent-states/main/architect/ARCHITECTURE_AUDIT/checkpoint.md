# ARCHITECTURE_AUDIT State Checkpoints

## When to Save Architecture Audit State

### Critical Checkpoint Triggers

1. **Audit Initiation** - When entering ARCHITECTURE_AUDIT state
   - Save: Audit scope, system boundaries, baseline metrics, assessment plan
   - Reason: Establish comprehensive audit scope and methodology

2. **Component Assessment Complete** - After completing each major component audit
   - Save: Individual component assessment results, findings, metrics
   - Reason: Preserve detailed component analysis before system-wide integration

3. **Cross-Component Analysis Complete** - After system-wide consistency analysis
   - Save: Architectural consistency findings, pattern drift analysis, integration issues
   - Reason: Critical data for overall architecture health determination

4. **Technical Debt Analysis Complete** - After comprehensive debt assessment
   - Save: Debt inventory, prioritization, impact analysis, remediation estimates
   - Reason: Debt analysis is time-intensive and critical for decision making

5. **Performance and Security Audits Complete** - After system-wide testing
   - Save: Performance benchmarks, security findings, compliance results
   - Reason: Performance and security data essential for architecture health

6. **Pre-Decision State** - Before making final architecture health determination
   - Save: Complete assessment results, calculated scores, evidence summary
   - Reason: Support architecture health decision and remediation planning

7. **Architecture Health Decision Made** - After determining final outcome
   - Save: Health assessment, remediation plan, architectural recommendations
   - Reason: Permanent record for system architecture approval and improvement

## Recovery Protocol for Architecture Audits

### State Recovery Procedure

1. **Detect Incomplete Architecture Audit**
   ```bash
   # Check for architecture audit checkpoint files
   find /checkpoints -name "architecture-audit-*.yaml" -mtime -14
   
   # Verify audit completion status  
   grep -q "audit_complete: true" latest_architecture_checkpoint.yaml
   ```

2. **Load Architecture Audit Context**
   ```yaml
   recovery_context:
     audit_id: "arch-audit-system-wide-2025-08-23"

       - "system_wide_consistency"
       - "performance_benchmarking" 
       - "security_audit"
       - "final_grading"
   ```

3. **Resume Architecture Audit**
   - Continue from last completed analysis phase
   - Validate system state hasn't changed significantly
   - Re-run time-sensitive assessments (performance, security scans)
   - Maintain audit methodology consistency

4. **Validate Recovery Integrity**
   ```yaml
   recovery_validation:
     checkpoint_integrity: "verified"
     system_state_consistency: "verified"
     assessment_methodology_unchanged: "verified"
     evidence_preservation: "complete"
   ```

### Architecture Audit Interruption Handling

#### Planned Interruptions
- **Pre-Interruption**: Save comprehensive state with detailed progress
- **During Interruption**: Preserve all assessment data and evidence
- **Post-Resume**: Validate system state and continue audit

#### Unplanned Interruptions
- **Detection**: Incomplete audit without completion marker
- **Recovery**: Load most recent comprehensive checkpoint
- **Continuation**: Resume from last completed major analysis phase
- **Validation**: Re-verify critical findings for consistency

### Checkpoint File Management

#### Checkpoint Naming Convention
```
architecture-audit-{audit-id}-{timestamp}-{status}.yaml

Examples:
- architecture-audit-system-wide-20250823-080000-initiated.yaml
- architecture-audit-system-wide-20250823-120000-components-assessed.yaml
- architecture-audit-system-wide-20250823-160000-system-analysis-complete.yaml
- architecture-audit-system-wide-20250823-183000-complete.yaml
```

#### Checkpoint Locations
- **Active Audits**: `/workspaces/architect-checkpoints/architecture-audits/active/`
- **Completed Audits**: `/workspaces/architect-checkpoints/architecture-audits/completed/`
- **Evidence Archive**: `/workspaces/architect-checkpoints/architecture-audits/evidence/`

#### Retention Policy
- **Active**: Keep until audit decision made
- **Completed**: Keep for 1 year after audit completion
- **Evidence**: Keep for 2 years for compliance and retrospective
- **Archive**: Permanent architectural reference storage

### Recovery Validation Checklist

Before resuming architecture audit after interruption:

- [ ] Checkpoint file integrity verified
- [ ] System architecture state unchanged
- [ ] All component code bases accessible
- [ ] Assessment tools and environments available
- [ ] Performance baseline data still valid
- [ ] Security scanning tools operational
- [ ] Evidence artifacts preserved and accessible
- [ ] Audit methodology documentation current
- [ ] Previous assessment results consistent and valid

### Emergency Recovery Procedures

If checkpoint data is corrupted or system state significantly changed:

1. **Architecture State Reconstruction**
   - Re-baseline system architecture from current state
   - Recreate performance and security baselines
   - Re-run component-level assessments from scratch
   - Document restart rationale and methodology changes

2. **Fresh Architecture Audit**
   - Start new comprehensive audit with updated baselines
   - Apply consistent methodology across all components
   - Preserve any valid evidence from previous attempt
   - Document previous audit attempt in audit record

3. **Escalation Triggers**
   - Multiple recovery failures indicate systemic issues
   - Major system architecture changes during interruption
   - Critical evidence artifacts permanently lost
   - Assessment tools or environments compromised
   - Significant methodology changes required
