| Minor conflicts - easily resolved | 85 | <4 hours | Document resolution |
| Moderate conflicts - complex resolution | 60 | 4-16 hours | Detailed conflict analysis |
| Major conflicts - architectural issues | 25 | >16 hours | Architecture review |
| Unresolvable conflicts | 0 | N/A | Integration blocked |

**Conflict Analysis Matrix**:

| CRD schema conflict | Medium | -15 | Schema harmonization |
| API version mismatch | Medium | -20 | Version compatibility layer |
| Controller logic conflict | High | -35 | Controller refactoring |
| Architectural mismatch | Critical | -75 | Redesign required |

### Performance Impact (25% - Benchmark Comparison)

| Metric | Weight | Baseline | Threshold | Warning | Critical |
|--------|--------|----------|-----------|---------|----------|
| API Response Time | 30% | Phase baseline | <+15% | +15-25% | >+25% |
| Memory Usage | 25% | Phase baseline | <+20% | +20-35% | >+35% |
| CPU Utilization | 20% | Phase baseline | <+25% | +25-40% | >+40% |
| Throughput | 15% | Phase baseline | <-10% | -10-20% | >-20% |
| Workspace Capacity | 10% | Phase baseline | ≥1000 workspaces | 500-999 | <500 |

**Performance Scoring Formula**:
```
For Increase Metrics (API Response, Memory, CPU):
Score = MAX(0, 100 - ((Actual_Increase - Threshold) / (Critical - Threshold)) × 100)

For Decrease Metrics (Throughput):
Score = MAX(0, 100 - ((Threshold - Actual_Decrease) / (Critical - Threshold)) × 100)

For Capacity Metrics:
Score = MIN(100, (Actual_Capacity / Target_Capacity) × 100)
```

**Performance Calculation Example**:
```yaml
baseline_metrics:
  api_response_time: 100ms
  memory_usage: 500MB
  cpu_usage: 2.0 cores
  throughput: 1000 req/s

integrated_metrics:
  api_response_time: 118ms    # +18% increase
  memory_usage: 580MB         # +16% increase
  cpu_usage: 2.4 cores        # +20% increase
  throughput: 920 req/s       # -8% decrease

scoring:
  api_response: 70 points     # +18% > 15% threshold, approaching 25% critical
  memory: 100 points          # +16% < 20% threshold
  cpu: 100 points             # +20% < 25% threshold
  throughput: 100 points      # -8% < 10% threshold
  
weighted_performance_score: (70×0.30) + (100×0.25) + (100×0.20) + (100×0.15) + (100×0.10) = 88.0%

## Action Item Generation

### INTEGRATION_ISSUES Action Items

Based on grade breakdown, generate specific remediation tasks:

**Merge Compatibility Issues**:
- "Resolve CRD schema conflict between Wave 2 webhook validation and Wave 3 config management"
- "Harmonize resource naming conventions across waves to eliminate collisions"
- "Estimated effort: 12 hours development + 6 hours testing"

**Performance Regression Issues**:
- "Optimize API response time - currently 18% above threshold, target <10%"
- "Investigate memory usage increase in integrated state - 22% above baseline"
- "Estimated effort: 16 hours optimization + 8 hours benchmarking"

**API Coherence Issues**:
- "Standardize error response formats across Wave 2 and Wave 3 APIs"
- "Add compatibility layer for version differences in webhook interfaces"

### INTEGRATION_BLOCKED Remediation

For blocked integrations, provide architectural guidance:

**Major Architectural Issues**:
- "Fundamental controller architecture mismatch between waves requires redesign"
- "Multi-tenancy boundary violations indicate design flaws - security review required"
- "Performance regression >25% suggests architectural scalability issues"

**Recommended Approach**:
- Conduct architecture review session with all wave teams
- Identify root cause of integration conflicts
- Design integration architecture that maintains wave independence
- Plan phased integration approach if full integration not feasible

### Quality Assurance Requirements

**Assessment Reproducibility**:
- All benchmark results preserved with test configurations
- Security test scripts and results archived
- Integration branch state tagged for future reference
- Assessment methodology documented for consistency

**Evidence Preservation**:
- Performance benchmark raw data and analysis
- Security test execution logs and results
- Merge conflict resolution documentation
- Test suite execution reports and failure analysis
