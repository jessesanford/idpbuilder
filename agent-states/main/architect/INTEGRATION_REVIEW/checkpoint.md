# INTEGRATION_REVIEW State Checkpoints

## When to Save Integration Review State

### Critical Checkpoint Triggers

1. **Integration Review Initiation** - When entering INTEGRATION_REVIEW state
   - Save: Phase context, waves to integrate, baseline metrics, integration scope
   - Reason: Establish integration assessment boundary and performance baselines

2. **Merge Compatibility Assessment Complete** - After all wave merges attempted
   - Save: Merge results, conflict analysis, resolution status, branch states
   - Reason: Preserve merge analysis before proceeding to performance testing

3. **Performance Benchmarking Complete** - After integrated performance testing
   - Save: Benchmark results, performance impact analysis, threshold compliance
   - Reason: Performance data critical for integration approval decision

4. **Security Testing Complete** - After multi-tenancy integrity validation
   - Save: Security test results, boundary verification, audit findings
   - Reason: Security validation results essential for approval

5. **Pre-Decision State** - Before making final integration decision
   - Save: Complete assessment data, calculated scores, evidence artifacts
   - Reason: Support integration decision audit and potential appeals

6. **Integration Decision Made** - After determining final outcome
   - Save: Decision rationale, action items, integration approval/rejection record
   - Reason: Permanent record for phase integration approval

## Recovery Protocol for Integration Reviews

### State Recovery Procedure

1. **Detect Incomplete Integration Review**
   ```bash
   # Check for integration checkpoint files
   find /checkpoints -name "integration-review-*.yaml" -mtime -3
   
   # Verify review completion
   grep -q "integration_complete: true" latest_integration_checkpoint.yaml
   ```

2. **Load Integration Context**
   ```yaml
   recovery_context:
     phase_id: "phase-1"
     waves_assessed: ["wave-1", "wave-2"]
     waves_remaining: ["wave-3"]
     completed_assessments:
       - "merge_compatibility"
       - "performance_benchmarking"
     remaining_assessments:
       - "security_testing"
       - "api_coherence_validation"
       - "final_grading"
   ```

3. **Resume Integration Review**
   - Continue from last completed assessment phase
   - Validate integration branch state unchanged
   - Re-run time-sensitive tests if needed (performance benchmarks)
   - Maintain assessment methodology consistency

4. **Validate Recovery Integrity**
   ```yaml
   recovery_validation:
     checkpoint_data_integrity: "verified"
     integration_branch_unchanged: "verified"
     evidence_artifacts_available: "verified"
     assessment_timeline_impact: "minimal_documented"
   ```

### Integration Review Interruption Handling

#### Planned Interruptions
- **Pre-Interruption**: Save complete state with assessment progress
- **During Interruption**: Preserve integration branch and test environments
- **Post-Resume**: Validate checkpoint integrity and branch state

#### Unplanned Interruptions
- **Detection**: Incomplete assessment without completion marker
- **Recovery**: Load most recent checkpoint with integrity validation
- **Continuation**: Resume from last completed assessment component
- **Validation**: Re-verify critical results for consistency

### Checkpoint File Management

#### Checkpoint Naming Convention
```
integration-review-{phase-id}-{timestamp}-{status}.yaml

Examples:
- integration-review-phase1-20250823-100000-initiated.yaml
- integration-review-phase1-20250823-130000-merge-complete.yaml
- integration-review-phase1-20250823-160000-performance-complete.yaml
- integration-review-phase1-20250823-164500-complete.yaml
```

#### Checkpoint Locations
- **Active Reviews**: `/workspaces/architect-checkpoints/integration-reviews/active/`
- **Completed Reviews**: `/workspaces/architect-checkpoints/integration-reviews/completed/`
- **Evidence Archive**: `/workspaces/architect-checkpoints/integration-reviews/evidence/`

#### Retention Policy
- **Active**: Keep until integration decision made
- **Completed**: Keep for 90 days after phase completion
- **Evidence**: Keep for 1 year for audit and retrospective analysis
- **Archive**: Permanent storage for architectural reference

### Recovery Validation Checklist

Before resuming integration review after interruption:

- [ ] Checkpoint file integrity verified
- [ ] Integration branch state unchanged
- [ ] All wave integration branches accessible
- [ ] Test environments and tools available
- [ ] Performance baseline data still valid
- [ ] Evidence artifacts preserved and accessible
- [ ] Assessment methodology unchanged
- [ ] Previous partial results validated for consistency

### Emergency Recovery Procedures

If checkpoint data is corrupted or integration state compromised:

1. **Integration State Reconstruction**
   - Rebuild integration branch from wave branches
   - Recreate test environments and baseline data
   - Re-run critical assessments from scratch
   - Document restart rationale and impact

2. **Fresh Integration Review**
   - Start new assessment with complete documentation
   - Apply consistent methodology across all assessments
   - Preserve any valid evidence from previous attempt
   - Note previous attempt in review record

3. **Escalation Conditions**
   - Multiple recovery failures indicate systemic issues
   - Integration branch corruption or significant changes
   - Critical evidence artifacts permanently lost
   - Assessment environment compromised or unavailable
