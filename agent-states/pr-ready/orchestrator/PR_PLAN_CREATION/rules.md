## 🔴🔴🔴 STOP! STATE RULE READING IS ABSOLUTELY FIRST! 🔴🔴🔴

**YOU HAVE ENTERED PR_PLAN_CREATION STATE - YOU MUST READ AND ACKNOWLEDGE ALL STATE RULES BEFORE DOING ANY STATE WORK!**

## 🔴🔴🔴 R290 VERIFICATION REQUIREMENT 🔴🔴🔴

**R290 ENFORCEMENT: CREATE VERIFICATION MARKER AFTER READING**

After reading and acknowledging all state rules, you MUST create a verification marker:

```bash
# MANDATORY: Create verification marker after reading rules
touch .state_rules_read_orchestrator_PR_PLAN_CREATION
echo "$(date +%s) - Rules read and acknowledged for PR_PLAN_CREATION" > .state_rules_read_orchestrator_PR_PLAN_CREATION
```

**FAILURE TO CREATE MARKER = AUTOMATIC -100% PENALTY**

The system will check for this marker. No marker = Immediate failure.

### ❌ DO NOT DO ANY PR PLANNING UNTIL RULES ARE READ:
- ❌ Start creating PR plan
- ❌ Generate PR messages
- ❌ Update state files
- ❌ Continue to next state
- ❌ Think about what to do in this state

### ✅ YOU MUST IMMEDIATELY:

## 🔴🔴🔴 MANDATORY STATE RULE READING AND ACKNOWLEDGMENT 🔴🔴🔴

### ⚠️⚠️⚠️ YOU MUST READ EACH RULE FILE LISTED IN PRIMARY DIRECTIVES. **I AM WATCHING YOUR TOOL CALLS FOR READ OPERATIONS** *YOU WILL FAIL* IF YOU DO NOT MAKE A READ FILE CALL FOR EACH RULE FILE IN PRIMARY DIRECTIVES!!! ⚠️⚠️⚠️

**AFTER READING, YOU MUST ACKNOWLEDGE ALL THE STATE RULES AND STATE THAT YOU WILL ABIDE BY THEM ONE AT A TIME GIVING THE RULE NUMBER AND DESCRIPTION.**

## 📋 PRIMARY DIRECTIVES

### 🚨🚨🚨 RULE R006 - Orchestrator NEVER Writes Code [BLOCKING]
**Source:** `$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/rule-library/R006-orchestrator-never-writes-code.md`
**Criticality:** BLOCKING - Any code operation = -100% IMMEDIATE FAILURE

READ THIS RULE FILE: `$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/rule-library/R006-orchestrator-never-writes-code.md`

**⚠️ R006 WARNING FOR PR_PLAN_CREATION STATE:**
- DO NOT edit any code in PR descriptions!
- DO NOT modify source files for PR preparation!
- DO NOT apply any last-minute fixes!
- You only create the PR PLAN document - NEVER touch code

### 🚨🚨🚨 RULE R370 - PR Plan Creation Requirements [BLOCKING]
**Source:** `$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/rule-library/R370-pr-plan-creation-requirements.md`
**Criticality:** BLOCKING - Humans need clear PR instructions

**This state implements R370 to create the MASTER-PR-PLAN.md for humans to execute**

Key requirements per R370:
- Document all effort branches in exact merge order
- Provide complete PR templates (title + body)
- Include copy-paste ready commands
- Document rollback procedures
- Create progress tracking checklist

Software Factory creates the plan, humans execute the PRs. We NEVER push to main.

PRs must be ordered by dependencies to avoid conflicts and ensure clean merges.

## 🎯 STATE OBJECTIVES

In the PR_PLAN_CREATION state, you are responsible for:

1. **Creating MASTER-PR-PLAN.md**
   - List all branches to be PRed
   - Specify exact merge order
   - Provide PR title and body for each
   - Include verification steps

2. **Determining Dependency Order**
   - Core/infrastructure first
   - Features that depend on core next
   - UI/frontend typically last
   - Independent features can be parallel

3. **Generating PR Templates**
   - Title following project conventions
   - Comprehensive description
   - Testing notes
   - Breaking changes if any

4. **Creating Merge Instructions**
   - Step-by-step process for humans
   - Verification between PRs
   - Rollback instructions if needed

## 📝 REQUIRED ACTIONS

### Step 1: Gather All Effort Information
```bash
# List all effort branches
echo "📋 Gathering effort branches..."
EFFORT_BRANCHES=""

for effort_dir in /efforts/*/; do
    if [ -d "$effort_dir/.git" ]; then
        effort_name=$(basename "$effort_dir")
        cd "$effort_dir"
        branch=$(git branch --show-current)
        
        if [ "$branch" != "main" ] && [ "$branch" != "integration-testing" ]; then
            echo "Found effort: $effort_name on branch: $branch"
            EFFORT_BRANCHES="$EFFORT_BRANCHES$branch "
            
            # Get commit count
            commit_count=$(git rev-list --count origin/main..HEAD 2>/dev/null || echo "unknown")
            echo "  Commits ahead of main: $commit_count"
            
            # Get changed files count
            changed_files=$(git diff --name-only origin/main..HEAD 2>/dev/null | wc -l)
            echo "  Files changed: $changed_files"
        fi
    fi
done

echo "Total effort branches: $(echo $EFFORT_BRANCHES | wc -w)"
```

### Step 2: Analyze Dependencies
```bash
# Read implementation plan to understand dependencies
if [ -f "/efforts/PROJECT-IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN.md" ]; then
    echo "📋 Reading implementation plan for dependencies..."
    grep -i "depend\|require\|before\|after" PROJECT-IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN.md || true
fi

# Check for explicit dependency documentation
for dep_file in DEPENDENCIES.md EFFORT-DEPENDENCIES.md effort-dependencies.txt; do
    if [ -f "$dep_file" ]; then
        echo "📋 Found dependency file: $dep_file"
        cat "$dep_file"
    fi
done
```

### Step 3: Create MASTER-PR-PLAN.md
```bash
cat > MASTER-PR-PLAN.md << 'EOF'
# MASTER PR PLAN
Generated: $(date)
By: Software Factory 2.0

## ⚠️ CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS

### 🔴 R006 VIOLATION DETECTION 
If you find yourself about to:
- Edit code to prepare for PRs
- Apply last-minute fixes before PR creation
- Modify source files for better PR descriptions
- Clean up code before documenting PRs
- Make excuses like "just tidying up for the PR"

**STOP IMMEDIATELY - You are violating R006!**
You create documentation ONLY - NO code modifications allowed!

### PR Order Must Reflect Dependencies
- Core infrastructure ALWAYS first
- Dependencies resolved before dependents
- Independent features can be parallel
- UI/frontend typically last

### Each PR Must Be Complete
- Include all commits from effort branch
- Have comprehensive description
- Reference any related issues
- Include test results

### Never Actually Create PRs
- Software Factory creates the PLAN
- Humans execute the plan
- We prepare everything, they click buttons

## 🚫 FORBIDDEN ACTIONS

1. **NEVER edit any code files** - R006 VIOLATION = -100%
2. **NEVER apply fixes before PR creation** - R006 VIOLATION = -100%
3. **NEVER modify source for PR prep** - R006 VIOLATION = -100%
4. **NEVER use `gh pr create` yourself**
5. **NEVER push to main branch**
6. **NEVER merge PRs automatically**
7. **NEVER skip dependency analysis**
8. **NEVER create incomplete PR plans**

## ✅ SUCCESS CRITERIA

Before transitioning to SUCCESS state:
- [ ] MASTER-PR-PLAN.md created
- [ ] All effort branches documented
- [ ] Merge order determined
- [ ] PR templates generated

- [ ] All files committed and pushed

## 🔄 STATE TRANSITIONS

### Success Path:
```
PR_PLAN_CREATION → SUCCESS
```
- PR plan complete
- All documentation ready
- Software Factory work complete!

### Error Path:
```
PR_PLAN_CREATION → ERROR_RECOVERY
```
- Missing effort information
- Cannot determine dependencies
- Branches not ready

## 📊 VERIFICATION CHECKLIST
