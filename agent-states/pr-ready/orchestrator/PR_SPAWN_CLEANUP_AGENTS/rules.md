### MANDATORY ACTIONS (R233 + R313 COMPLIANT)
Upon entering this state, IMMEDIATELY:

1. **Spawn SW Engineer(s) for artifact removal**
   ```bash
   # For parallel cleanup (if branches independent)
   /spawn agent-sw-engineer PR_ARTIFACT_REMOVAL \
     --branches "branch1,branch2,branch3" \
     --cleanup-manifest "PR-CLEANUP-MANIFEST.json" \
     --parallel true

   # OR for sequential cleanup (if dependencies exist)
   /spawn agent-sw-engineer PR_ARTIFACT_REMOVAL \
     --branch "branch1" \
     --cleanup-list "PR-CLEANUP-TASKS-branch1.md"
   ```

2. **Spawn Integration Agent if main needs reset**
   ```bash
   # Only if main is contaminated
   /spawn agent-integration PR_MAIN_RESET \
     --upstream "upstream/main" \
     --preserve-commits "[legitimate-sha-list]"
   ```

3. **Record cleanup assignments**
   ```json
   {
     "cleanup_agents": {
       "sw_engineer_1": {
         "id": "swe-cleanup-<timestamp>",
         "branches": ["branch1", "branch2"],
         "task": "artifact_removal"
       },
       "integration": {
         "id": "int-main-<timestamp>",
         "task": "main_reset",
