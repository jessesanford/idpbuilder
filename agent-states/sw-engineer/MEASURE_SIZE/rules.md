# SW Engineer - MEASURE_SIZE State Rules

## State Context
You have reached a size checkpoint or warning threshold and need to measure exact size compliance and plan next steps.

## 🔴🔴🔴 CRITICAL: Finding the Line Counter Tool 🔴🔴🔴

**SPLIT EFFORTS ARE DIFFERENT** - They have their own git repositories!

```bash
# UNIVERSAL LINE COUNTER FINDER - Works for both splits and normal efforts
find_line_counter() {
    echo "🔍 Finding line counter tool..."
    
    # Check if this is a split effort
    if ls SPLIT-PLAN-*.md 2>/dev/null | head -1 > /dev/null; then
        echo "📂 Split effort detected - searching UP directory tree"
        IS_SPLIT=true
    else
        echo "📂 Normal effort - searching for project root"
        IS_SPLIT=false
    fi
    
    # Strategy 1: Search UP the directory tree for tools/line-counter.sh
    SEARCH_DIR=$(pwd)

    LEVEL=0
    
    while [ "$SEARCH_DIR" != "/" ] && [ $LEVEL -lt $MAX_LEVELS ]; do

            echo "✅ Found line counter at: $LINE_COUNTER"
            return 0
        fi
        SEARCH_DIR=$(dirname "$SEARCH_DIR")
        LEVEL=$((LEVEL + 1))
    done

                echo "✅ Found via orchestrator-state.yaml: $LINE_COUNTER"
                return 0
            fi
        fi

            return 0
        fi
    done
    
    echo "❌ ERROR: Could not find line-counter.sh"
    echo "   Searched from: $(pwd)"
    echo "   Try running: find /home -name 'line-counter.sh' 2>/dev/null"
    return 1
}

# Find the tool
find_line_counter

# Run measurement if found
if [ -n "$LINE_COUNTER" ]; then

### ⚠️ RULE R107.0.0 - MEASURE_SIZE Rules
**Source:** rule-library/RULE-REGISTRY.md#R107
**Criticality:** IMPORTANT - Affects workflow

SIZE MEASUREMENT PROTOCOL:
1. Find line counter using the universal finder above
2. Generate detailed breakdown analysis
3. Determine exact compliance status
4. Calculate remaining capacity or overflow
5. Make transition decision based on measurement
6. Document findings and recommendations
---

## Mandatory Size Measurement

---
### 🚨🚨 RULE R007.0.0 - Size Limit Enforcement
**Source:** rule-library/RULE-REGISTRY.md#R007
**Criticality:** MANDATORY - Required for approval

MEASUREMENT REQUIREMENTS:

⚠️ CRITICAL: Use ONLY the project's line-counter.sh tool
⚠️ NEVER count lines manually or with other tools
⚠️ Exclude generated code automatically

REQUIRED MEASUREMENTS:
1. Total effort size (primary metric)
2. Size breakdown by package/directory
3. Growth trend analysis
4. Remaining capacity calculation

DECISION MATRIX:
- ≤700 lines: CONTINUE implementation
- 701-750 lines: OPTIMIZE or prepare for completion
- 751-800 lines: COMPLETE immediately or split
- >800 lines: MANDATORY split required

## Quick Measurement Commands

For quick measurement without the full analysis:

```bash
# Quick measure for normal efforts
LC=$(d=$(pwd); while [ "$d" != "/" ]; do [ -f "$d/tools/line-counter.sh" ] && echo "$d/tools/line-counter.sh" && break; d=$(dirname "$d"); done)
[ -n "$LC" ] && "$LC" || echo "Tool not found"

# Quick measure for split efforts (with branch)
LC=$(d=$(pwd); while [ "$d" != "/" ]; do [ -f "$d/tools/line-counter.sh" ] && echo "$d/tools/line-counter.sh" && break; d=$(dirname "$d"); done)
[ -n "$LC" ] && "$LC" -c "$(git branch --show-current)" || echo "Tool not found"
```

## Decision Making Framework

---
### 🚨🚨 RULE R020.0.0 - State Transitions
**Source:** rule-library/RULE-REGISTRY.md#R020
**Criticality:** MANDATORY - Required for approval

SIZE-BASED DECISION MATRIX:

>800 LINES (VIOLATION):
→ SPLIT_WORK (mandatory)
→ Document violation and split strategy

751-800 LINES (DANGER):
→ Evaluate completion feasibility
→ IMPLEMENTATION if <10% work remaining
→ SPLIT_WORK if >10% work remaining

701-750 LINES (WARNING):
→ Optimize current code if opportunities exist
→ IMPLEMENTATION with careful monitoring
→ Consider completion strategy

≤700 LINES (COMPLIANT):
→ IMPLEMENTATION (safe to continue)
→ Continue normal development pace
---

## State Transitions

From MEASURE_SIZE state:
- **SIZE_COMPLIANT** → IMPLEMENTATION (Continue development safely)
- **SIZE_WARNING** → IMPLEMENTATION (Continue with enhanced monitoring)
- **SIZE_DANGER** → IMPLEMENTATION or SPLIT_WORK (Based on completion analysis)
- **SIZE_VIOLATION** → SPLIT_WORK (Mandatory split required)
- **OPTIMIZATION_IDENTIFIED** → FIX_ISSUES (Refactor before continuing)

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue: "Line counter not found"
**Solution**: Use the universal finder script above

### Issue: "Not in a git repository"
**For Splits**: You ARE in a git repo (sparse checkout). Use `-c branch-name` parameter

### Issue: "Branch doesn't exist"
**Check**: Run `git branch --show-current` to get exact branch name

### Issue: "Fatal: bad revision"
**Fix**: The branch name might have typos. Copy from `git branch --show-current`

## Remember

1. **Splits are different** - They're sparse checkouts with separate git repos
2. **Search UP for tools** - The main project is above split directories  
3. **Use branch parameter for splits** - Auto-detection may fail
4. **Never hardcode paths** - Projects can be in different locations
5. **Log all measurements** - Update work-log.md with results
