# WAVE_REVIEW State Rules

## üî¥üî¥üî¥ CRITICAL: REPORT LOCATION REQUIREMENTS üî¥üî¥üî¥

**YOU MUST CREATE THE WAVE REVIEW REPORT IN THE EXACT LOCATION:**
```bash
# MANDATORY LOCATION:
Directory: wave-reviews/phase{N}/wave{W}/
Filename:  PHASE-{N}-WAVE-{W}-REVIEW-REPORT.md
Full path: wave-reviews/phase{N}/wave{W}/PHASE-{N}-WAVE-{W}-REVIEW-REPORT.md

# EXAMPLE for Phase 1, Wave 2:
mkdir -p wave-reviews/phase1/wave2
Write wave-reviews/phase1/wave2/PHASE-1-WAVE-2-REVIEW-REPORT.md

# WRONG LOCATIONS (WILL FAIL):
‚ùå ~/WAVE-1-2-REVIEW-REPORT.md                      # Root directory
‚ùå PHASE-1-WAVE-2-REVIEW-REPORT.md                  # Current directory
‚ùå ./WAVE-REVIEW.md                                 # Current directory
‚ùå reports/PHASE-1-WAVE-2-REVIEW-REPORT.md          # Wrong directory
‚ùå wave2/PHASE-1-WAVE-2-REVIEW-REPORT.md            # Missing parent directories
‚ùå phase1/wave2/PHASE-1-WAVE-2-REVIEW-REPORT.md     # Missing wave-reviews parent

# CORRECT LOCATION (ONLY THIS WORKS):
‚úÖ wave-reviews/phase1/wave2/PHASE-1-WAVE-2-REVIEW-REPORT.md
```

**VERIFICATION FUNCTION - USE THIS:**
```bash
verify_wave_report_location() {
    local PHASE=$1
    local WAVE=$2
    local EXPECTED="wave-reviews/phase${PHASE}/wave${WAVE}/PHASE-${PHASE}-WAVE-${WAVE}-REVIEW-REPORT.md"
    
    if [[ ! -f "$EXPECTED" ]]; then
        echo "‚ùå CRITICAL ERROR: Report not in correct location!"
        echo "‚ùå Expected: $EXPECTED"
        echo "‚ùå Orchestrator will NOT find your report!"
        exit 1
    fi
    echo "‚úÖ Report in correct location: $EXPECTED"
}

# ALWAYS verify after creating:
verify_wave_report_location 1 2  # For Phase 1, Wave 2
```

**PENALTY FOR WRONG LOCATION: -50% grading penalty, orchestrator cannot proceed**

## Core Wave Assessment Rules

---
### üî¥üî¥üî¥ RULE R308 - Incremental Branching Verification
**Source:** rule-library/R308-incremental-branching-strategy.md
**Criticality:** CORE TENANT - Foundation of trunk-based development

MANDATE: Verify ALL efforts in this wave branched from correct incremental base:
- Wave 1 efforts: Should branch from main
- Wave 2+ efforts: Should branch from previous wave integration
- Phase 2+ Wave 1: Should branch from previous phase integration

VERIFICATION STEPS:
1. Check orchestrator-state.json for current_phase and current_wave
2. Determine expected base branch using R308 logic
3. For each effort, verify it includes previous wave's commits
4. Confirm no efforts branched from stale main when should use integration

**VIOLATION = -100% FAILURE if efforts used wrong base branch**
---

---
### üö®üö®üö® RULE R297 - Architect Split Detection Protocol
**Source:** rule-library/R297-architect-split-detection-protocol.md
**Criticality:** BLOCKING - Must check splits BEFORE measuring integration

MANDATE: Check split_count in orchestrator-state.json BEFORE measuring any effort.
If split_count > 0, the effort was already split and is COMPLIANT.
Integration branches merge all splits (will exceed limits - EXPECTED).
Measure ORIGINAL effort branches, NOT integration branches.
PRs come from effort branches, NOT integration.
---

---
### üö®üö® RULE R074.0.0 - Wave Completion Architectural Review
**Source:** rule-library/RULE-REGISTRY.md#R074
**Criticality:** MANDATORY - Required for approval

MANDATE: Architect must review completed waves before
integration into phase. Assess effort integration quality,
architectural consistency, and readiness for wave integration.

ASSESSMENT CRITERIA:
- Effort size compliance (<800 lines per effort)
- KCP pattern consistency across all efforts
- API coherence within wave scope
- Integration test coverage and pass rates
- Performance impact on existing components
---

---
### ‚ÑπÔ∏è RULE R075.0.0 - Wave Integration Readiness
**Source:** rule-library/RULE-REGISTRY.md#R075
**Criticality:** INFO - Best practice

MANDATE: Before wave integration approval, verify all efforts
are properly tested, documented, and maintain system
stability when combined.

INTEGRATION REQUIREMENTS:
- All efforts merge cleanly with wave integration branch
- No architectural conflicts between efforts
- Combined wave maintains KCP multi-tenancy guarantees
- Performance degradation within acceptable limits
- Security boundaries preserved across all efforts
---

---
### üö® RULE R076.0.0 - Effort Size Compliance Verification
**Source:** rule-library/RULE-REGISTRY.md#R076
**Criticality:** CRITICAL - Major impact on grading

MANDATE: Every effort in wave must be ‚â§800 lines as measured
by the line counter tool. Oversized efforts require split
before wave approval.

ENFORCEMENT:
- Use ONLY `$PROJECT_ROOT/tools/line-counter.sh` for measurement
- Navigate TO each effort directory before measuring
- Run with NO PARAMETERS (tool auto-detects branch)
- Exclude generated code (zz_generated*, *.pb.go, CRDs) - automatic
- Split efforts >800 lines before integration
- Verify all splits maintain functional coherence
- Document split rationale and dependencies
---

### üö®üö®üö® RULE R022 - Architect Size Verification Protocol
**Source:** rule-library/R022-architect-size-verification.md
**Criticality:** BLOCKING - Measurement errors = invalid review

**CRITICAL: How Architects MUST Measure Sizes:**
```bash
# For EACH effort in the wave:
cd /path/to/efforts/phase2/wave2/effort-name

# Find project root (where orchestrator-state.json lives):
PROJECT_ROOT=$(pwd)
while [ "$PROJECT_ROOT" != "/" ]; do
    [ -f "$PROJECT_ROOT/orchestrator-state.json" ] && break
    PROJECT_ROOT=$(dirname "$PROJECT_ROOT")
done

# Run line counter with NO PARAMETERS:
$PROJECT_ROOT/tools/line-counter.sh  # NO PARAMETERS!
```

**‚ùå NEVER DO THIS:**
- `./tools/line-counter.sh phase2/wave2/effort-name` (NO parameters!)
- `$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/tools/line-counter.sh` (often undefined!)
- Manual counting or alternative tools (ONLY use line-counter.sh per R304!)
---

---
### ‚ÑπÔ∏è RULE R037.0.0 - KCP Resource Pattern Enforcement
**Source:** rule-library/RULE-REGISTRY.md#R037
**Criticality:** INFO - Best practice

MANDATE: All wave components must maintain KCP multi-tenant
patterns with workspace isolation and logical cluster support.

WAVE-LEVEL VALIDATION:
- Consistent LogicalCluster field usage across efforts
- Workspace-aware resource controllers
- Proper RBAC scoping for multi-tenancy
- Event and status propagation within workspace boundaries
- Cross-effort API compatibility
---

## State-Specific Context

### üö®üö®üö® RULE R258 - Mandatory Wave Review Report [BLOCKING]
**Source:** rule-library/R258-mandatory-wave-review-report.md
**Criticality:** BLOCKING - No wave progression without report

**MANDATE**: Architect MUST create a permanent wave review report file before signaling review complete.

**REQUIRED FILE**: `wave-reviews/phase{N}/wave{W}/PHASE-{N}-WAVE-{W}-REVIEW-REPORT.md`
‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è **SEE CRITICAL LOCATION SECTION AT TOP OF THIS FILE** ‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è

**üî¥ STEP-BY-STEP INSTRUCTIONS:**
```bash
# Step 1: Get phase and wave numbers
PHASE=1  # From orchestrator-state.json
WAVE=2   # From orchestrator-state.json

# Step 2: CREATE DIRECTORY STRUCTURE (MANDATORY!)
mkdir -p wave-reviews/phase${PHASE}/wave${WAVE}

# Step 3: Set exact report path
REPORT_FILE="wave-reviews/phase${PHASE}/wave${WAVE}/PHASE-${PHASE}-WAVE-${WAVE}-REVIEW-REPORT.md"

# Step 4: Create report with Write tool using EXACT path
# Example: Write wave-reviews/phase1/wave2/PHASE-1-WAVE-2-REVIEW-REPORT.md

# Step 5: Verify location (CRITICAL!)
ls -la wave-reviews/phase${PHASE}/wave${WAVE}/
[[ -f "$REPORT_FILE" ]] || { echo "‚ùå FAILED!"; exit 1; }

# Step 6: Commit and push
git add "$REPORT_FILE"
git commit -m "review: Phase ${PHASE} Wave ${WAVE} review - ${DECISION}"
git push
```

**DECISION TYPES**:
- PROCEED_NEXT_WAVE: Wave approved, start next wave
- PROCEED_PHASE_ASSESSMENT: Last wave complete, trigger phase assessment  
- CHANGES_REQUIRED: Fixes needed before progression
- WAVE_FAILED: Major issues, cannot proceed

**üö®üö®üö® FORBIDDEN DECISIONS - NEVER ALLOWED IN WAVE_REVIEW üö®üö®üö®**:
- ‚ùå END_PHASE: The architect CANNOT end phases
- ‚ùå PROJECT_COMPLETE: The architect CANNOT end the project
- ‚ùå END_PROJECT: The architect CANNOT terminate the project
- ‚ùå SKIP_PHASE: The architect CANNOT skip phases

**CRITICAL REMINDERS**:
- You are reviewing a WAVE, not a PHASE
- You CANNOT make project-level decisions
- You CANNOT skip or end phases
- Only the ORCHESTRATOR decides when to end the project
- You CANNOT signal wave review complete without creating this report!
---

### WAVE_REVIEW State Purpose
This state is entered when all efforts in a wave are complete and need architectural review before wave integration. The architect validates effort cohesion, size compliance, and integration readiness.

### State Transitions

**ENTRY CONDITIONS:**
- All efforts in wave marked as `EFFORT_COMPLETE`
- Wave integration branch created by orchestrator
- No outstanding code review issues (all efforts approved)

**EXIT CONDITIONS:**
- **PROCEED_NEXT_WAVE**: Wave meets all architectural standards ‚Üí Approve for next wave
- **PROCEED_PHASE_ASSESSMENT**: Last wave complete and approved ‚Üí Trigger phase assessment
- **CHANGES_REQUIRED**: Issues identified requiring fixes ‚Üí Return to orchestrator with specific actions
- **WAVE_FAILED**: Major architectural problems ‚Üí Halt wave progression, require redesign

**‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è ARCHITECT AUTHORITY LIMITS ‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è**:
- The architect reviews and recommends, but CANNOT control project flow
- The architect CANNOT end phases or the project
- The architect CANNOT skip any phases, even if they seem complete
- All phases in the plan MUST be executed - no exceptions
- Only the ORCHESTRATOR has authority to end the project

**STATE TRANSITION FLOW:**
```
WAVE_REVIEW ‚Üí [Assessment Complete] ‚Üí Decision State
‚îú‚îÄ PROCEED ‚Üí Wave Integration Approved
‚îú‚îÄ CHANGES_REQUIRED ‚Üí Fix Cycle (orchestrator coordinates)
‚îî‚îÄ STOP ‚Üí Wave Redesign Required
```

## Wave Assessment Criteria

### Primary Assessment Areas

| Area | Weight | Critical Threshold | Pass Criteria |
|------|--------|-------------------|---------------|
| Size Compliance | 25% | 100% efforts ‚â§800 lines | All pass |
| KCP Pattern Consistency | 25% | No pattern violations | All pass |
| Integration Stability | 20% | Clean merge + tests pass | 95% success |
| API Coherence | 15% | No conflicting interfaces | All resolved |
| Performance Impact | 10% | <10% degradation | Within limits |
| Documentation Quality | 5% | Complete work logs | 90% coverage |

### Size Compliance Assessment

**CRITICAL REQUIREMENT**: Every effort must be ‚â§800 lines (R297 MUST be checked FIRST!)
- **Split Detection**: Check split_count BEFORE measuring (R297)
- **Measurement Tool**: `$PROJECT_ROOT/tools/line-counter.sh` (find project root first!)
- **Measurement Target**: ORIGINAL effort branches, NOT integration branches
- **Exclusions**: Generated code (zz_generated*.go, *.pb.go, CRDs, SDK clients) - automatic
- **Action on Violation**: Immediate STOP, require effort splitting

**Size Assessment Process** (Per R297 and R022):
1. **CHECK SPLIT_COUNT FIRST** (R297):
   - Read `split_count` from orchestrator-state.json
   - If > 0: Mark as COMPLIANT, skip size measurement
   - If 0: Continue to measure original branch
2. Navigate TO each effort directory (cd /efforts/phase*/wave*/[effort-name])
3. Find project root: `while [ "$PWD" != "/" ]; do [ -f orchestrator-state.json ] && break; cd ..; done`
4. Run line counter with NO PARAMETERS: `$PROJECT_ROOT/tools/line-counter.sh`
5. Document results in assessment report  
6. Flag any efforts >800 lines for splitting
7. Verify splits maintain logical coherence
8. **NEVER measure integration branch for compliance** (integration merges all splits)

### KCP Pattern Consistency Assessment

**CONSISTENCY REQUIREMENTS**:
- Uniform LogicalCluster field usage across all efforts
- Consistent workspace isolation patterns
- Compatible RBAC models between efforts
- Aligned event handling and status reporting

**Pattern Validation Checklist**:
- [ ] All CRDs include LogicalCluster metadata field
- [ ] Controllers use workspace-scoped clients consistently
- [ ] Resource indexing includes workspace context
- [ ] Cross-effort APIs don't violate workspace boundaries
- [ ] Event propagation respects multi-tenancy

## Integration Readiness Validation

### Pre-Integration Requirements

1. **Clean Merge Validation**
   - All effort branches merge without conflicts
   - No duplicate resource definitions
   - Consistent dependency versions

2. **Integration Testing**
   - Cross-effort integration tests pass
   - Performance regression tests complete
   - End-to-end workflows functional

3. **API Compatibility**
   - No breaking changes between efforts
   - Consistent API patterns and naming
   - Backward compatibility maintained

### Wave Integration Approval Criteria

**PROCEED CONDITIONS** (All must be true):
- ‚úÖ All efforts size-compliant (R297: check split_count first, then measure original branches ‚â§800 lines)
- ‚úÖ All KCP patterns consistent across efforts
- ‚úÖ Wave integration branch merges cleanly
- ‚úÖ Integration tests pass with >95% success rate
- ‚úÖ Performance impact <10% degradation
- ‚úÖ No security boundary violations
- ‚úÖ Split efforts recognized as compliant (even if integration exceeds limit)

**CHANGES_REQUIRED CONDITIONS**:
- Minor API inconsistencies between efforts
- Integration test failures <5% (fixable issues)
- Performance regression 10-20% (optimization needed)
- Documentation gaps in work logs

**STOP CONDITIONS**:
- Any effort >800 lines (splitting required)
- KCP pattern violations (multi-tenancy broken)
- Major integration conflicts (architectural mismatch)
- Performance regression >20% (design issue)
- Security vulnerabilities introduced
