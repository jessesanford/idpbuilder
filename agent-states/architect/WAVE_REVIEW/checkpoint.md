# WAVE_REVIEW State Checkpoints

## When to Save Wave Review State

### Critical Checkpoint Triggers

1. **Wave Review Initiation** - When entering WAVE_REVIEW state
   - Save: Wave scope, effort list, assessment baseline
   - Reason: Establish review boundary and effort inventory

2. **Effort Assessment Completion** - After completing each effort evaluation
   - Save: Individual effort grades, issues found, evidence artifacts
   - Reason: Preserve individual assessments for wave score calculation

3. **Integration Testing Complete** - After wave integration testing finishes
   - Save: Integration test results, merge status, performance benchmarks
   - Reason: Critical data for integration stability scoring

4. **Pre-Decision State** - Before making PROCEED/CHANGES_REQUIRED/STOP decision
   - Save: Complete wave assessment, calculated scores, evidence summary
   - Reason: Support decision audit and potential reconsideration

5. **Decision Made** - After determining final wave review outcome
   - Save: Decision rationale, action items, next steps, approval record
   - Reason: Permanent record for wave integration approval/rejection

## Recovery Protocol for Wave Reviews

### State Recovery Procedure

1. **Detect Incomplete Wave Review**
   ```bash
   # Check for wave review checkpoint files
   find /checkpoints -name "wave-review-*.yaml" -mtime -7
   
   # Verify review completion status
   grep -q "review_complete: true" latest_wave_checkpoint.yaml
   ```

2. **Load Wave Review Context**
   ```yaml
   # From checkpoint file
   recovery_context:
     wave_id: "phase-1-wave-2"
     efforts_assessed: ["webhook-core", "webhook-validation"]
     efforts_remaining: ["config-management"]
     completed_phases:
       - "individual_effort_assessment"
       - "size_compliance_verification"
     remaining_phases:
       - "integration_testing"
       - "performance_benchmarking"
       - "final_grading"
   ```

3. **Resume Wave Review Process**
   - Continue from last completed assessment phase
   - Validate existing evidence artifacts are accessible
   - Re-run time-sensitive tests (performance benchmarks)
   - Maintain assessment methodology consistency

4. **Validate Recovery Integrity**
   ```yaml
   recovery_validation:
     checkpoint_integrity: "verified"
     evidence_artifacts: "accessible"
     assessment_consistency: "maintained"
     timeline_impact: "documented"
   ```

### Wave Review Interruption Handling

#### Planned Interruptions
- **Before Pause**: Save complete state with current assessment progress
- **During Pause**: Preserve all test results and evidence artifacts
- **After Resume**: Validate checkpoint and continue from last phase

#### Unplanned Interruptions
- **Detection**: Incomplete checkpoint without completion marker
- **Recovery**: Load most recent valid checkpoint state
- **Continuation**: Resume from last completed assessment phase
- **Validation**: Cross-check partial results for consistency

### Checkpoint File Management

#### Checkpoint File Naming Convention
```
wave-review-{wave-id}-{timestamp}-{status}.yaml

Examples:
- wave-review-phase1-wave2-20250823-093000-initiated.yaml
- wave-review-phase1-wave2-20250823-123000-efforts-assessed.yaml
- wave-review-phase1-wave2-20250823-143000-integration-tested.yaml
- wave-review-phase1-wave2-20250823-153000-complete.yaml
```

#### Checkpoint File Locations
- **Active Reviews**: `/workspaces/architect-checkpoints/wave-reviews/active/`
- **Completed Reviews**: `/workspaces/architect-checkpoints/wave-reviews/completed/`
- **Evidence Archive**: `/workspaces/architect-checkpoints/wave-reviews/evidence/`

#### Checkpoint Retention Policy
- **Active**: Keep until wave review complete
- **Completed**: Keep for 60 days after wave integration
- **Evidence**: Keep for 6 months for audit purposes
- **Archive**: Long-term storage for project retrospectives

### Recovery Validation Checklist

Before resuming wave review after interruption:

- [ ] Checkpoint file integrity verified
- [ ] All evidence artifacts accessible and valid
- [ ] Wave integration branch state unchanged
- [ ] Individual effort branches still accessible
- [ ] Assessment methodology documentation current
- [ ] Testing tools and environments available
- [ ] Performance baseline data still valid
- [ ] Previous individual effort assessments consistent

### Emergency Recovery Procedures

If checkpoint data is corrupted or lost:

1. **Reconstruct Wave Review State**
   - Examine orchestrator state for wave context
   - Re-identify efforts in wave scope
   - Recreate evidence artifacts from source data
   - Document review restart rationale

2. **Fresh Wave Review Protocol**
   - Begin new assessment with full methodology
   - Document previous attempt in review record
   - Apply consistent standards across all efforts
   - Preserve any valid prior evidence artifacts

3. **Escalation Triggers**
   - Multiple recovery failures indicate systemic issues
   - Evidence artifacts permanently corrupted or lost
   - Wave integration branch significantly altered
   - Assessment methodology changed during interruption
   - Performance baseline no longer valid
