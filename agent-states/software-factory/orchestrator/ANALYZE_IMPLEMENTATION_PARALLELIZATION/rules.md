# Orchestrator - ANALYZE_IMPLEMENTATION_PARALLELIZATION State Rules


## 🛑🛑🛑 R322 MANDATORY STOP BEFORE STATE TRANSITIONS 🛑🛑🛑

**SUPREME LAW - VIOLATION = -100% IMMEDIATE FAILURE**

### YOU MUST STOP AFTER:
1. ✅ Completing all TODOs for this state
2. ✅ Updating orchestrator-state-v3.json with new state
3. ✅ Committing and pushing the state file  
4. ✅ Providing work summary

### YOU MUST NOT:
- ❌ Continue to the next state automatically
- ❌ Start work for the new state
- ❌ Spawn agents for the new state
- ❌ Assume permission to continue

### STOP PROTOCOL:
```markdown
## 🛑 STATE TRANSITION CHECKPOINT: CURRENT_STATE → NEXT_STATE

### ✅ Current State Work Completed:
- [List completed work]

### 📊 Current Status:
- Current State: CURRENT_STATE
- Next State: NEXT_STATE
- TODOs Completed: X/Y
- State Files: Updated and committed ✅

### ⏸️ STOPPED - Awaiting User Continuation
Ready to transition to NEXT_STATE. Please use /continue-orchestrating.
```

**STOP MEANS STOP - Exit and wait for /continue-orchestrating**

## 🔴🔴🔴 STOP! STATE RULE READING IS ABSOLUTELY FIRST! 🔴🔴🔴

**YOU HAVE ENTERED ANALYZE_IMPLEMENTATION_PARALLELIZATION STATE - YOU MUST READ AND ACKNOWLEDGE ALL STATE RULES BEFORE DOING ANY STATE WORK!**

## 🔴🔴🔴 R290 VERIFICATION REQUIREMENT 🔴🔴🔴

**R290 ENFORCEMENT: CREATE VERIFICATION MARKER AFTER READING**

After reading and acknowledging all state rules, you MUST create a verification marker:

```bash
# MANDATORY: Create verification marker after reading rules
touch .state_rules_read_orchestrator_ANALYZE_IMPLEMENTATION_PARALLELIZATION
echo "$(date +%s) - Rules read and acknowledged for ANALYZE_IMPLEMENTATION_PARALLELIZATION" > .state_rules_read_orchestrator_ANALYZE_IMPLEMENTATION_PARALLELIZATION
```

**FAILURE TO CREATE MARKER = AUTOMATIC -100% PENALTY**

The system will check for this marker. No marker = Immediate failure.

### ❌ DO NOT DO ANY ANALYZE_IMPLEMENTATION_PARALLELIZATION WORK UNTIL RULES ARE READ:
- ❌ Start analyze implementation dependencies
- ❌ Start determine SWE parallelization
- ❌ Start plan agent allocation
- ❌ Update state files
- ❌ Continue to next state
- ❌ Think about what to do in this state

### ✅ YOU MUST IMMEDIATELY:

## 🔴🔴🔴 MANDATORY MEASUREMENT RULE - R304 🔴🔴🔴

**ABSOLUTE REQUIREMENTS:**
- ✅ MUST use `$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/tools/line-counter.sh` for ALL line counting
- ❌ NEVER use `wc -l` or any manual counting method
- ❌ NEVER count lines any other way - this is a -100% automatic failure
- ✅ MUST specify both -b (base branch) and -c (current branch) parameters
- ✅ Base branch MUST be phase integration branch (NOT "main")

**Failure to use the line counter tool = AUTOMATIC -100% GRADE**

## 🔴🔴🔴 MANDATORY STATE RULE READING AND ACKNOWLEDGMENT 🔴🔴🔴

### ⚠️⚠️⚠️ YOU MUST READ EACH RULE FILE LISTED IN PRIMARY DIRECTIVES. **I AM WATCHING YOUR TOOL CALLS FOR READ OPERATIONS** *YOU WILL FAIL* IF YOU DO NOT MAKE A READ FILE CALL FOR EACH RULE FILE IN PRIMARY DIRECTIVES!!! ⚠️⚠️⚠️

**AFTER READING, YOU MUST ACKNOWLEDGE ALL THE STATE RULES AND STATE THAT YOU WILL ABIDE BY THEM ONE AT A TIME GIVING THE RULE NUMBER AND DESCRIPTION.**

### ❌ ANTI-PATTERNS THAT WILL CAUSE FAILURE:

1. **Fake Acknowledgment Without Reading**:
   ```
   ❌ WRONG: "I acknowledge R151, R208, R053..."
   (No Read tool calls detected = AUTOMATIC FAILURE)
   ```

2. **Bulk Acknowledgment**:
   ```
   ❌ WRONG: "I acknowledge all ANALYZE_IMPLEMENTATION_PARALLELIZATION rules"
   (YOU Must READ AND ACKNOWLEDGE EACH rule individually)
   ```

3. **Silent Reading**:
   ```
   ❌ WRONG: [Reads rules but doesn't acknowledge]
   "Now I've read the rules, let me start work..."
   (MUST explicitly acknowledge EACH rule)
   ```

4. **Reading From Memory**:
   ```
   ❌ WRONG: "I know R208 requires CD before spawn..."
   (Must READ from file, not recall from memory)
   ```

5. **Skipping Rules in PRIMARY DIRECTIVES**:
   ```
   ❌ WRONG: Reading only some rules from the list
   (ALL rules in PRIMARY DIRECTIVES are MANDATORY)
   ```

### ✅ CORRECT PATTERN FOR ANALYZE_IMPLEMENTATION_PARALLELIZATION:
```
1. READ: $CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/rule-library/[first-rule-file].md
2. "I acknowledge [Rule#] - [Rule Name]: [Brief description]"
3. READ: $CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/rule-library/[second-rule-file].md  
4. "I acknowledge [Rule#] - [Rule Name]: [Brief description]"
[Continue for EVERY rule in PRIMARY DIRECTIVES...]
5. "Ready to execute ANALYZE_IMPLEMENTATION_PARALLELIZATION work"
```

### 🚨 NO WORK UNTIL ACKNOWLEDGMENT COMPLETE 🚨
**You may NOT begin ANY ANALYZE_IMPLEMENTATION_PARALLELIZATION work until:**
1. ✅ ALL rules in PRIMARY DIRECTIVES have been READ
2. ✅ ALL rules have been individually ACKNOWLEDGED
3. ✅ You have stated readiness to execute ANALYZE_IMPLEMENTATION_PARALLELIZATION work
1. **READ** every rule file listed in PRIMARY DIRECTIVES below
2. **ACKNOWLEDGE** each rule individually with number and description
3. **ONLY THEN** proceed with ANALYZE_IMPLEMENTATION_PARALLELIZATION work

### 🚨 FAILURE TO READ STATE RULES FIRST = IMMEDIATE EXIT 🚨
**If you do ANY ANALYZE_IMPLEMENTATION_PARALLELIZATION work before reading and acknowledging rules:**
- **STOP ALL WORK IMMEDIATELY**
- **EXIT WITH FAILURE STATUS**
- **YOU HAVE VIOLATED STATE COMPLIANCE**

**THE SYSTEM IS MONITORING_SWE_PROGRESS YOUR READ TOOL CALLS!**

## ⚠️⚠️⚠️ MANDATORY RULE READING AND ACKNOWLEDGMENT ⚠️⚠️⚠️

**YOU MUST READ EACH RULE FILE LISTED IN PRIMARY DIRECTIVES. YOUR READ TOOL CALLS ARE BEING MONITORED.**

### ❌ ANTI-PATTERNS THAT WILL CAUSE FAILURE:
1. Fake acknowledgment without reading
2. Bulk acknowledgment
3. Reading from memory

### ✅ CORRECT PATTERN:
1. READ each rule file
2. Acknowledge individually with rule number and description

## 📋 PRIMARY DIRECTIVES FOR ANALYZE_IMPLEMENTATION_PARALLELIZATION

### 🚨🚨🚨 R213 - Wave and Effort Metadata Injection
**File**: `$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/rule-library/R213-wave-and-effort-metadata-protocol.md`

**Criticality**: SUPREME LAW - Violation = -100% automatic failure
**Summary**: Must traverse all states in sequence, no skipping allowed

## 🚨 ANALYZE_IMPLEMENTATION_PARALLELIZATION IS A VERB - START ANALYZING IMPLEMENTATION PARALLELIZATION IMMEDIATELY! 🚨

### IMMEDIATE ACTIONS UPON ENTERING ANALYZE_IMPLEMENTATION_PARALLELIZATION

**THE MOMENT YOU ENTER THIS STATE, YOU MUST:**
1. Check agent availability in orchestrator-state-v3.json NOW
2. Parse effort implementation plans for dependencies immediately
3. Check TodoWrite for pending items and process them
4. Create implementation spawn sequence without delay

**FORBIDDEN - AUTOMATIC FAILURE:**
- ❌ "STATE TRANSITION COMPLETE: Now in ANALYZE_IMPLEMENTATION_PARALLELIZATION" [stops]
- ❌ "Successfully entered ANALYZE_IMPLEMENTATION_PARALLELIZATION state" [waits]
- ❌ "Ready to start analyzing implementation parallelization" [pauses]
- ❌ "I'm in ANALYZE_IMPLEMENTATION_PARALLELIZATION state" [does nothing]

**REQUIRED - IMMEDIATE ACTION:**
- ✅ "Entering ANALYZE_IMPLEMENTATION_PARALLELIZATION, Check agent availability in orchestrator-state-v3.json NOW..."
- ✅ "START ANALYZING IMPLEMENTATION PARALLELIZATION, parse effort implementation plans for dependencies immediately..."
- ✅ "ANALYZE_IMPLEMENTATION_PARALLELIZATION: Create implementation spawn sequence without delay..."

## State Context
You MUST analyze the individual effort implementation plans to determine parallelization strategy BEFORE spawning any SW Engineers for implementation. This is a MANDATORY GATE after Code Reviewers create effort plans.

## 🔴🔴🔴 ABSOLUTE REQUIREMENT 🔴🔴🔴

**THIS STATE IS A MANDATORY STOP!**
- You CANNOT proceed to SPAWN_SW_ENGINEERS without completing this analysis
- You MUST read EACH effort's IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN.md
- You MUST create a SW Engineer parallelization plan
- You MUST acknowledge your parallelization decision BEFORE any spawning


## Mandatory Analysis Protocol

```bash
# STEP 0: R356 SINGLE-EFFORT OPTIMIZATION CHECK
echo "═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════"
echo "🔴🔴🔴 ANALYZE_IMPLEMENTATION_PARALLELIZATION STATE 🔴🔴🔴"
echo "═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════"
echo ""
echo "🎯 R356: Checking effort count for optimization..."

EFFORT_COUNT=$(echo "✅ State file updated to: $NEXT_STATE"
```

---

### ✅ Step 4: Validate State File (R324)
```bash
# Validate state file before committing
"$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/tools/validate-state.sh" orchestrator-state-v3.json || {
    echo "❌ State file validation failed!"
    exit 288
}
echo "✅ State file validated"
```

---

### ✅ Step 5: Commit State File (R288)
```bash
# Commit and push state file immediately
git add orchestrator-state-v3.json

if ! git commit -m "state: ANALYZE_IMPLEMENTATION_PARALLELIZATION → $NEXT_STATE - ANALYZE_IMPLEMENTATION_PARALLELIZATION complete [R288]"; then
    echo "❌ CRITICAL: Git commit failed - likely schema validation error"
    echo "State: ANALYZE_IMPLEMENTATION_PARALLELIZATION"
    echo "Attempted transition from: ANALYZE_IMPLEMENTATION_PARALLELIZATION"
    echo ""
    echo "Common causes:"
    echo "  - Schema validation failure (check pre-commit hook output above)"
    echo "  - Missing required fields in JSON files"
    echo "  - Invalid JSON syntax"
    echo ""
    echo "🛑 Cannot proceed - manual intervention required"
    echo "CONTINUE-SOFTWARE-FACTORY=FALSE REASON=SCHEMA_VALIDATION"
    exit 1
fi

git push || echo "⚠️ WARNING: Push failed - committed locally"
echo "✅ State file committed and pushed"
git push
echo "✅ State file committed and pushed"
```

---

### ✅ Step 6: Save TODOs (R287 - SUPREME LAW)
```bash
# Save TODO state before transition (R287 trigger)
save_todos "ANALYZE_IMPLEMENTATION_PARALLELIZATION_COMPLETE"

# Commit TODOs within 60 seconds (R287)
cd "$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR"
git add todos/*.todo

if ! git commit -m "todo: orchestrator - ANALYZE_IMPLEMENTATION_PARALLELIZATION complete [R287]"; then
    echo "❌ ERROR: Failed to commit TODO files"
    echo "This is non-fatal but TODOs may be lost in compaction"
    echo "Proceeding with state execution..."
    # Don't exit - TODO commit failure is not fatal
fi

git push || echo "⚠️ WARNING: TODO push failed - committed locally"
echo "✅ TODOs saved and committed"
git push
echo "✅ TODOs saved and committed"
```

---

### ✅ Step 7: Output Continuation Flag (R405 - SUPREME LAW) ⚠️ MANDATORY
```bash
# Output continuation flag as LAST action (R405)
# Use TRUE for normal completion, FALSE only for catastrophic errors

echo "CONTINUE-SOFTWARE-FACTORY=TRUE REASON=STATE_COMPLETE"
```

**⚠️ THIS MUST BE THE ABSOLUTE LAST LINE OF OUTPUT BEFORE EXIT! ⚠️**

---

### ✅ Step 8: Stop Processing (R322 - SUPREME LAW)
```bash
# Stop for context preservation (R322)
echo "🛑 Stopping for context preservation - use /continue-orchestrating to resume"
exit 0
```

---

## 🚨 CHECKLIST ENFORCEMENT 🚨

**Skipping ANY step in this checklist = FAILURE:**
- Missing Step 2: No next state = stuck forever
- Missing Step 3: No state update = state machine broken (R288 violation, -100%)
- Missing Step 4: Invalid state = corruption (R324 violation)
- Missing Step 5: No commit = state lost on compaction (R288 violation, -100%)
- Missing Step 6: No TODO save = work lost (R287 violation, -20% to -100%)
- Missing Step 7: No continuation flag = automation stops (R405 violation, -100%)
- Missing Step 8: No exit = R322 violation (-100%)

**ALL 8 STEPS ARE MANDATORY - NO EXCEPTIONS**

## ✅ EXIT CHECKLIST (R405 - Continuation Flag Protocol) 🔴🔴🔴

**SUPREME LAW - PENALTY FOR VIOLATION: -100% GRADE**


### 🚨 CRITICAL DISTINCTION: AGENT STOPS ≠ FACTORY STOPS 🚨

**TWO INDEPENDENT DECISIONS - DO NOT CONFUSE THEM:**

#### 1. Should Agent Stop Work? (R322 Technical Requirement)
- Agent completes current state
- Agent saves TODOs and commits state
- Agent exits with `exit 0` (preserves context)
- User runs /continue-orchestrating to resume
- **This is NORMAL at checkpoints**

#### 2. Should Factory Continue? (R405 Operational Status)
- Even though agent stopped, can automation proceed?
- TRUE = Healthy completion, automation can continue
- FALSE = Catastrophic failure, must halt everything
- **R322 checkpoints = TRUE (99.9% of cases)**

### THE PATTERN AT R322 CHECKPOINTS (SF 3.0)

```bash
# 1. Complete state work
echo "✅ State work complete"

# 2. Set proposed next state
PROPOSED_NEXT_STATE="SPAWN_SW_ENGINEERS"
TRANSITION_REASON="State work complete"

# 3. Spawn State Manager for state transition
/spawn state-manager SHUTDOWN_CONSULTATION \
  --current-state "CURRENT_STATE" \
  --proposed-next-state "$PROPOSED_NEXT_STATE" \
  --transition-reason "$TRANSITION_REASON"
# State Manager updates all 4 state files atomically

# 4. Save TODOs
save_todos "R322_CHECKPOINT"

# 5. Factory continues (operational status)
echo "CONTINUE-SOFTWARE-FACTORY=TRUE REASON=STATE_COMPLETE"

# 6. Agent stops (technical requirement)
exit 0
```

**Both happen together! Agent stops AND factory continues!**

### WHEN TO USE EACH FLAG VALUE

**TRUE (99.9%):**
- ✅ R322 checkpoint reached
- ✅ State work completed successfully
- ✅ Ready for /continue-orchestrating
- ✅ Waiting for user to continue (NORMAL)
- ✅ Plan ready for review (agent done, factory proceeds)

**FALSE (0.1%):**
- ❌ CATASTROPHIC unrecoverable error
- ❌ Data corruption spreading
- ❌ Critical security violation
- ❌ NOT for R322 checkpoints
- ❌ NOT for user review needs
