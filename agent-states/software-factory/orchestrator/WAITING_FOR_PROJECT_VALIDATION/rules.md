# Orchestrator - WAITING_FOR_PROJECT_VALIDATION State Rules



## 🔴🔴🔴 MANDATORY STATE RULE READING AND ACKNOWLEDGMENT 🔴🔴🔴

### ⚠️⚠️⚠️ YOU MUST READ EACH RULE FILE LISTED IN PRIMARY DIRECTIVES. **I AM WATCHING YOUR TOOL CALLS FOR READ OPERATIONS** *YOU WILL FAIL* IF YOU DO NOT MAKE A READ FILE CALL FOR EACH RULE FILE IN PRIMARY DIRECTIVES!!! ⚠️⚠️⚠️

**AFTER READING, YOU MUST ACKNOWLEDGE ALL THE STATE RULES AND STATE THAT YOU WILL ABIDE BY THEM ONE AT A TIME GIVING THE RULE NUMBER AND DESCRIPTION.**

## 📋 PRIMARY DIRECTIVES FOR WAITING_FOR_PROJECT_VALIDATION STATE

### Core Mandatory Rules (ALL orchestrator states must have these):

1. **🚨🚨🚨 R006** - ORCHESTRATOR NEVER WRITES CODE OR PERFORMS FILE OPERATIONS (BLOCKING)
   - File: `$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/rule-library/R006-orchestrator-never-writes-code.md`
   - Criticality: BLOCKING - Automatic termination, 0% grade
   - Summary: NEVER write, copy, move, or manipulate ANY code files - delegate ALL to agents

2. **🔴🔴🔴 R287** - TODO PERSISTENCE COMPREHENSIVE (SUPREME LAW)
   - File: `$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/rule-library/R287-todo-persistence-comprehensive.md`
   - Criticality: SUPREME - -20% to -100% penalty for violations
   - Summary: MUST save TODOs within 30s after write, every 10 messages, before transitions

3. **🔴🔴🔴 R288** - STATE FILE UPDATE REQUIREMENTS (SUPREME LAW)
   - File: `$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/rule-library/R288-state-file-update-and-commit-protocol.md`
   - Criticality: SUPREME - State updates required for all transitions
   - Summary: MUST update orchestrator-state-v3.json before EVERY state transition

4. **🔴🔴🔴 R322 Part A** - Mandatory Stop After Spawn States
   - File: `$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/rule-library/R322-mandatory-stop-before-state-transitions.md`
   - Criticality: SUPREME LAW - Must stop after spawning
   - Summary: ALL spawn states require STOP after spawning agents

### State-Specific Rules:

5. **🔴🔴🔴 R233** - Immediate Action On State Entry
   - File: `$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/rule-library/R233-all-states-immediate-action.md`
   - Criticality: SUPREME LAW - Must act immediately on entering state
   - Summary: WAITING states require active monitoring, not passive waiting

## 🛑🛑🛑 R322 MANDATORY STOP BEFORE STATE TRANSITIONS 🛑🛑🛑

**SUPREME LAW - VIOLATION = -100% IMMEDIATE FAILURE**

### YOU MUST STOP AFTER:
1. ✅ Completing all TODOs for this state
2. ✅ Updating orchestrator-state-v3.json with new state
3. ✅ Committing and pushing the state file  
4. ✅ Providing work summary

### YOU MUST NOT:
- ❌ Continue to the next state automatically
- ❌ Start work for the new state
- ❌ Spawn agents for the new state
- ❌ Assume permission to continue

### STOP PROTOCOL:
```markdown
## 🛑 STATE TRANSITION CHECKPOINT: CURRENT_STATE → NEXT_STATE

### ✅ Current State Work Completed:
- [List completed work]

### 📊 Current Status:
- Current State: CURRENT_STATE
- Next State: NEXT_STATE
- TODOs Completed: X/Y
- State Files: Updated and committed ✅

### ⏸️ STOPPED - Awaiting User Continuation
Ready to transition to NEXT_STATE. Please use /continue-orchestrating.
```

**STOP MEANS STOP - Exit and wait for /continue-orchestrating**

## State Context

**Purpose:**
Wait for Code Reviewer to complete comprehensive validation of the integrated project.

## Primary Actions

1. **Check for Validation Report**:
   - Look for PROJECT-VALIDATION-REPORT.md
   - Review validation results
2. **Evaluate Results**:
   - PASS: All phases work together correctly
   - FAIL: Inter-phase issues found
   - BLOCKED: Cannot validate due to errors
3. **Document Issues** if validation fails

## Valid State Transitions

- **PASS** → CREATE_INTEGRATE_WAVE_EFFORTS_TESTING (project validated)
- **FAIL** → ERROR_RECOVERY (validation failed)
- **BLOCKED** → ERROR_RECOVERY (cannot validate)


## 🔴🔴🔴 STATE COMPLETION CHECKLIST 🔴🔴🔴

**Execute these steps IN ORDER to properly complete WAITING_FOR_PROJECT_VALIDATION:**

### ✅ Step 1: Complete State-Specific Work
**Refer to "Primary Actions" and "Mandatory Validations" sections above for state-specific tasks.**

Once all state work is complete, proceed to mandatory exit protocol:

---

### ✅ Step 2: Set Proposed Next State and Transition Reason
```bash
# Based on state work results, set variables for State Manager
PROPOSED_NEXT_STATE="[DETERMINE_FROM_STATE_LOGIC]"
TRANSITION_REASON="[REASON_FOR_TRANSITION]"
echo "Proposed next state: $PROPOSED_NEXT_STATE"
echo "Transition reason: $TRANSITION_REASON"
```

---

### ✅ Step 3: Spawn State Manager for State Transition (R288 - SUPREME LAW)
```bash
# State Manager handles ALL state file updates atomically
/spawn state-manager SHUTDOWN_CONSULTATION \
  --current-state "CURRENT_STATE_NAME" \
  --proposed-next-state "$PROPOSED_NEXT_STATE" \
  --transition-reason "$TRANSITION_REASON"

# State Manager will:
# 1. Validate the transition against state machine
# 2. Update all 4 state tracking locations atomically:
#    - orchestrator-state-v3.json
#    - orchestrator-state-demo.json
#    - .cascade-state-backup.json
#    - .orchestrator-state-v3.json
# 3. Commit and push all changes
# 4. Return control

echo "✅ State Manager completed transition"
```

---

### ✅ Step 4: Save TODOs (R287 - SUPREME LAW)
```bash
# Save TODO state before exit (R287 trigger)
save_todos "STATE_COMPLETE"

# Commit TODOs within 60 seconds (R287)
cd "$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR"
git add todos/*.todo

if ! git commit -m "todo: orchestrator - state complete [R287]"; then
    echo "❌ ERROR: Failed to commit TODO files"
    echo "This is non-fatal but TODOs may be lost in compaction"
    echo "Proceeding with state execution..."
    # Don't exit - TODO commit failure is not fatal
fi

git push || echo "⚠️ WARNING: TODO push failed - committed locally"
echo "✅ TODOs saved and committed"
git push
echo "✅ TODOs saved and committed"
```

---

### ✅ Step 5: Output Continuation Flag (R405 - SUPREME LAW) ⚠️ MANDATORY
```bash
# Output continuation flag as LAST action (R405)
# Use TRUE for normal completion, FALSE only for catastrophic errors

echo "CONTINUE-SOFTWARE-FACTORY=TRUE REASON=STATE_COMPLETE"
```

**⚠️ THIS MUST BE THE ABSOLUTE LAST LINE OF OUTPUT BEFORE EXIT! ⚠️**

---

### ✅ Step 6: Stop Processing (R322 - SUPREME LAW)
```bash
# Stop for context preservation (R322)
echo "🛑 Stopping for context preservation - use /continue-orchestrating to resume"
exit 0
```

---

## 🚨 CHECKLIST ENFORCEMENT 🚨

**Skipping ANY step in this checklist = FAILURE:**
- Missing Step 2: No next state = stuck forever
- Missing Step 3: No State Manager spawn = state machine broken (R288 violation, -100%)
- Missing Step 4: No TODO save = work lost (R287 violation, -20% to -100%)
- Missing Step 5: No continuation flag = automation stops (R405 violation, -100%)
- Missing Step 6: No exit = R322 violation (-100%)

**ALL 6 STEPS ARE MANDATORY - NO EXCEPTIONS**
**NOTE**: State file validation and commits now handled by State Manager (SF 3.0 pattern)


## ✅ EXIT CHECKLIST (R405 - Continuation Flag Protocol) 🔴🔴🔴

**SUPREME LAW - PENALTY FOR VIOLATION: -100% GRADE**


### 🚨 CRITICAL DISTINCTION: AGENT STOPS ≠ FACTORY STOPS 🚨

**TWO INDEPENDENT DECISIONS - DO NOT CONFUSE THEM:**

#### 1. Should Agent Stop Work? (R322 Technical Requirement)
- Agent completes current state
- Agent saves TODOs and commits state
- Agent exits with `exit 0` (preserves context)
- User runs /continue-orchestrating to resume
- **This is NORMAL at checkpoints**

#### 2. Should Factory Continue? (R405 Operational Status)
- Even though agent stopped, can automation proceed?
- TRUE = Healthy completion, automation can continue
- FALSE = Catastrophic failure, must halt everything
- **R322 checkpoints = TRUE (99.9% of cases)**

### THE PATTERN AT R322 CHECKPOINTS (SF 3.0)

```bash
# 1. Complete state work
echo "✅ State work complete"

# 2. Set proposed next state
PROPOSED_NEXT_STATE="PR_PLAN_CREATION"
TRANSITION_REASON="State work complete"

# 3. Spawn State Manager for state transition
/spawn state-manager SHUTDOWN_CONSULTATION \
  --current-state "CURRENT_STATE" \
  --proposed-next-state "$PROPOSED_NEXT_STATE" \
  --transition-reason "$TRANSITION_REASON"
# State Manager updates all 4 state files atomically

# 4. Save TODOs
save_todos "R322_CHECKPOINT"

# 5. Factory continues (operational status)
echo "CONTINUE-SOFTWARE-FACTORY=TRUE REASON=STATE_COMPLETE"

# 6. Agent stops (technical requirement)
exit 0
```

**Both happen together! Agent stops AND factory continues!**

### WHEN TO USE EACH FLAG VALUE

**TRUE (99.9%):**
- ✅ R322 checkpoint reached
- ✅ State work completed successfully
- ✅ Ready for /continue-orchestrating
- ✅ Waiting for user to continue (NORMAL)
- ✅ Plan ready for review (agent done, factory proceeds)

**FALSE (0.1%):**
- ❌ CATASTROPHIC unrecoverable error
- ❌ Data corruption spreading
- ❌ Critical security violation
- ❌ NOT for R322 checkpoints
- ❌ NOT for user review needs
### 🚨 WAITING STATE PATTERN - CRITICAL UNDERSTANDING 🚨

**This is a WAITING state. Common source of incorrect FALSE usage!**

**WRONG interpretation:**
> "R322 mandates stop before transition"
> "State work is complete (validation done)"
> "User needs to invoke /continue-orchestrating"
> "Therefore I must set CONTINUE-SOFTWARE-FACTORY=FALSE"

**CORRECT interpretation:**
> "R322 checkpoint is NORMAL procedure for context preservation"
> "State work completed successfully = NORMAL outcome"
> "Waiting for /continue is DESIGNED user experience"
> "System KNOWS next step from state file"
> "NO manual intervention required, just normal continuation"
> "Therefore set CONTINUE-SOFTWARE-FACTORY=TRUE"

**The key distinction:**
- **Stopping inference** (`exit 0`) = Context management (ALWAYS at R322 points)
- **Continuation flag** = Can automation proceed? (TRUE unless catastrophic failure)

**ONLY use FALSE if:**
- ❌ The thing we're waiting for completely disappeared (agents crashed with no recovery)
- ❌ Results arrived but are completely corrupted/unreadable
- ❌ State file corruption prevents determining what to wait for
- ❌ System deadlock with no automated resolution
