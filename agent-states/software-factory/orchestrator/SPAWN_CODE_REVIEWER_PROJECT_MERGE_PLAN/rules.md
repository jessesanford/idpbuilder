# Orchestrator - SPAWN_CODE_REVIEWER_PROJECT_MERGE_PLAN State Rules

# PRIMARY DIRECTIVES

## 🔴🔴🔴 ABSOLUTE REQUIREMENT: STATE MANAGER CONSULTATION 🔴🔴🔴

**SUPREME LAW - R517 - UNIVERSAL STATE MANAGER CONSULTATION LAW**

**BEFORE EXITING THIS STATE, YOU MUST:**

1. **SPAWN STATE MANAGER FOR SHUTDOWN_CONSULTATION** (MANDATORY - NO EXCEPTIONS)
2. **NEVER UPDATE STATE FILES DIRECTLY** (orchestrator-state-v3.json, bug-tracking.json, etc.)
3. **NEVER COMMIT STATE FILES YOURSELF** (State Manager does this atomically)

**FAILURE TO CONSULT STATE MANAGER = IMMEDIATE SYSTEM HALT (-100% GRADE)**

### Enforcement Mechanism

If you attempt to exit this state without spawning State Manager:
- ❌ Pre-commit hooks will REJECT your commit
- ❌ Validation tools will FAIL the build
- ❌ Grading system will assign -100% penalty
- ❌ System will transition to ERROR_RECOVERY

### Required Pattern (COPY THIS EXACTLY)

```bash
# At end of state work, BEFORE any state file updates:

echo "🔴 MANDATORY: Spawning State Manager for SHUTDOWN_CONSULTATION"

# Spawn State Manager (REQUIRED - NOT OPTIONAL)
# Task: state-manager
# State: SHUTDOWN_CONSULTATION
# Current State: [YOUR_CURRENT_STATE]
# Proposed Next State: [YOUR_PROPOSED_NEXT_STATE]
# Work Summary: [SUMMARY_OF_WORK_COMPLETED]

# State Manager will:
# 1. Validate proposed transition against state machine
# 2. Update all 4 state files atomically
# 3. Commit with [R288] tag
# 4. Return REQUIRED next state (may differ from proposal)

# Wait for State Manager response
# Follow State Manager's directive (REQUIRED next state)
# DO NOT proceed until State Manager confirms
```

**YOU MUST NEVER:**
- ❌ Update orchestrator-state-v3.json yourself
- ❌ Update bug-tracking.json yourself
- ❌ Update integration-containers.json yourself
- ❌ Use `jq` to modify state files
- ❌ Use `sed/awk` to modify state files
- ❌ Set `validated_by: "orchestrator"` (must be "state-manager")
- ❌ Skip State Manager consultation "just this once"
- ❌ Think "I'll validate it manually"

**ONLY State Manager may update state files. This is NON-NEGOTIABLE.**

# 🔴🔴🔴 MANDATORY: R322 STOP + R405 CONTINUATION FLAG 🔴🔴🔴

**CRITICAL FOR SPAWN STATES - READ THIS FIRST OR FAIL TEST 2!**

## 🚨 THE PATTERN THAT FAILED TEST 2 🚨

**WHAT HAPPENED IN TEST 2:**
- Orchestrator spawned Code Reviewers ✅ (correct)
- Orchestrator stopped per R322 ✅ (correct)
- Orchestrator **DID NOT emit `CONTINUE-SOFTWARE-FACTORY=TRUE`** ❌ (WRONG!)
- Test framework saw no continuation flag → stopped automation
- Test 2 FAILED at iteration 8

**ROOT CAUSE:** Confusion between R322 "stop" and R405 continuation flag

## 🔴 CRITICAL DISTINCTION: TWO INDEPENDENT DECISIONS 🔴

### Decision 1: Should Agent Stop? (R322 - Context Preservation)
**YES - ALWAYS stop after spawning for context preservation**

- **Purpose**: Prevent context overflow between states
- **Action**: `exit 0` to end conversation
- **User Experience**: User sees "/continue-orchestrating" as next step
- **This is NORMAL!** Not an error!

### Decision 2: Should Factory Continue? (R405 - Automation Control)
**YES - ALWAYS emit TRUE for normal spawning operations**

- **Purpose**: Tell automation whether it CAN restart
- **Action**: `echo "CONTINUE-SOFTWARE-FACTORY=TRUE REASON=STATE_COMPLETE"` (LAST output before exit)
- **Automation**: Framework will auto-restart orchestrator
- **This is NORMAL!** Designed behavior!

## ✅ REQUIRED PATTERN FOR ALL SPAWN STATES

```bash
# 1. Complete spawning work
echo "✅ Spawned [agent type] for [purpose]"

# 2. Update state file per R324/R288
update_state "[NEXT_STATE]"
commit_state_files_per_r288()

# 3. Save TODOs per R287
save_todos "SPAWNED_[AGENT_TYPE]"

# 4. R322: Stop conversation (context preservation)
echo "🛑 R322: Stopping after spawn for context preservation"

# 5. R405: CONTINUATION FLAG - MUST BE TRUE FOR SPAWNING!
echo "CONTINUE-SOFTWARE-FACTORY=TRUE REASON=STATE_COMPLETE"

# 6. Exit to end conversation
exit 0
```

## ❌ WRONG PATTERN (CAUSES TEST FAILURES)

```bash
# ❌ THIS KILLS AUTOMATION - DO NOT DO THIS!
echo "CONTINUE-SOFTWARE-FACTORY=FALSE REASON=MANUAL_INTERVENTION_REQUIRED"
exit 0

# Result: Test framework stops, Test 2 fails at iteration 8
```

## 🎯 WHY TRUE IS CORRECT FOR SPAWNING

**Spawning is NORMAL operation:**
- ✅ System knows next state (from state machine)
- ✅ Automation can continue (designed workflow)
- ✅ No manual intervention needed
- ✅ Context preservation ≠ error condition

**The orchestrator stopping (`exit 0`) is for:**
- Preserving context between conversation turns
- Allowing state file commits
- Creating clean state boundaries

**The TRUE flag indicates:**
- Automation CAN restart the conversation
- System knows what to do next (check state file)
- Normal operation is proceeding

## 🔴 WHEN TO USE FALSE (NOT FOR SPAWNING!)

**FALSE should ONLY be used for catastrophic failures:**
- ❌ State file corrupted beyond parsing
- ❌ Critical infrastructure destroyed
- ❌ Unrecoverable system errors
- ❌ **NEVER for normal spawning operations!**

## 📋 SPAWN STATE CHECKLIST

**Before exiting this spawn state, verify:**
1. [ ] All agents spawned successfully
2. [ ] State file updated to next state per R324
3. [ ] State files committed per R288
4. [ ] TODOs saved per R287
5. [ ] R322 stop message displayed
6. [ ] **CONTINUE-SOFTWARE-FACTORY=TRUE emitted** ← Critical!
7. [ ] Exited with `exit 0`

**Missing step 6 = Test 2 failure = -100% grade**

## 🔴🔴🔴 MANDATORY STATE RULE READING AND ACKNOWLEDGMENT 🔴🔴🔴

## 🛑🛑🛑 R322 MANDATORY STOP BEFORE STATE TRANSITIONS 🛑🛑🛑

**SUPREME LAW - VIOLATION = -100% IMMEDIATE FAILURE**

### YOU MUST STOP AFTER:
1. ✅ Completing all TODOs for this state
2. ✅ Updating orchestrator-state-v3.json with new state
3. ✅ Committing and pushing the state file  
4. ✅ Providing work summary

### YOU MUST NOT:
- ❌ Continue to the next state automatically
- ❌ Start work for the new state
- ❌ Spawn agents for the new state
- ❌ Assume permission to continue

### STOP PROTOCOL:
```markdown
## 🛑 STATE TRANSITION CHECKPOINT: CURRENT_STATE → NEXT_STATE

### ✅ Current State Work Completed:
- [List completed work]

### 📊 Current Status:
- Current State: CURRENT_STATE
- Next State: NEXT_STATE
- TODOs Completed: X/Y
- State Files: Updated and committed ✅

### ⏸️ STOPPED - Awaiting User Continuation
Ready to transition to NEXT_STATE. Please use /continue-orchestrating.
```

**STOP MEANS STOP - Exit and wait for /continue-orchestrating**

---

## 🛑🛑🛑 R322 Part A MANDATORY STOP AFTER SPAWNING AGENTS 🛑🛑🛑

**SUPREME LAW - VIOLATION = -100% IMMEDIATE FAILURE**

You MUST STOP IMMEDIATELY after spawning the Code Reviewer to preserve context:
- Record what was spawned in state file
- Save TODOs and commit state changes
- EXIT with clear continuation instructions
- This prevents agent responses from overflowing context

## State Context

**Purpose:**
Spawn Code Reviewer to create a comprehensive merge plan for integrating all phase branches into the project integration branch.

## Primary Actions

1. **Spawn Code Reviewer** with PROJECT_MERGE_PLANNING directive
2. **Provide Context**:
   - List of all phase integration branches
   - Target project integration branch
   - Dependency order requirements (R270)
3. **Update State File** with spawned agent details
4. **STOP per R322 Part A** - Exit immediately after spawning

## Valid State Transitions

- **PROJECT_DONE** → WAITING_FOR_PROJECT_MERGE_PLAN (agent spawned)



## 🔴🔴🔴 STATE COMPLETION CHECKLIST 🔴🔴🔴

**Execute these steps IN ORDER to properly complete SPAWN_CODE_REVIEWER_PROJECT_MERGE_PLAN:**

### ✅ Step 1: Complete State-Specific Work
**Refer to "Primary Actions" and "Mandatory Validations" sections above for state-specific tasks.**

Once all state work is complete, proceed to mandatory exit protocol:

---

### ✅ Step 2: Set Proposed Next State and Transition Reason
```bash
# Based on state work results, determine proposed next state
PROPOSED_NEXT_STATE="[DETERMINE_FROM_STATE_LOGIC]"
TRANSITION_REASON="SPAWN_CODE_REVIEWER_PROJECT_MERGE_PLAN complete - [describe what was accomplished]"
echo "Proposed next state: $PROPOSED_NEXT_STATE"
echo "Transition reason: $TRANSITION_REASON"
```

---

### ✅ Step 3: Update State File (R288 - SUPREME LAW)
```bash
# State Manager validates transition and updates state files (SF 3.0 Pattern)
echo "🔄 Spawning State Manager for SHUTDOWN_CONSULTATION..."

# Prepare work results summary
WORK_RESULTS=$(cat <<EOF
{
  "state_completed": "SPAWN_CODE_REVIEWER_PROJECT_MERGE_PLAN",
  "work_accomplished": [
    "[List accomplishments from state work]"
  ],
  "proposed_next_state": "$PROPOSED_NEXT_STATE",
  "transition_reason": "$TRANSITION_REASON"
}
EOF
)

# Spawn State Manager
/spawn state-manager SHUTDOWN_CONSULTATION \
  --current-state "SPAWN_CODE_REVIEWER_PROJECT_MERGE_PLAN" \
  --proposed-next-state "$PROPOSED_NEXT_STATE" \
  --transition-reason "$TRANSITION_REASON" \
  --work-results "$WORK_RESULTS"

# State Manager will:
# 1. Validate PROPOSED_NEXT_STATE exists and transition is valid
# 2. Update all 4 state files atomically (R288)
# 3. Commit and push state files
# 4. Return REQUIRED_NEXT_STATE (usually same as proposed unless invalid)

echo "✅ State Manager consultation complete"
echo "✅ State files updated by State Manager"
```

---

### ✅ Step 4: Validate State File (R324)
```bash
# Validate state file before committing
"$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/tools/validate-state.sh" orchestrator-state-v3.json || {
    echo "❌ State file validation failed!"
    exit 288
}
echo "✅ State file validated"
```

---

### ✅ Step 5: Commit State File (R288)
```bash
# Commit and push state file immediately
git add orchestrator-state-v3.json

if ! git commit -m "state: SPAWN_CODE_REVIEWER_PROJECT_MERGE_PLAN → $NEXT_STATE - SPAWN_CODE_REVIEWER_PROJECT_MERGE_PLAN complete [R288]"; then
    echo "❌ CRITICAL: Git commit failed - likely schema validation error"
    echo "State: SPAWN_CODE_REVIEWER_PROJECT_MERGE_PLAN"
    echo "Attempted transition from: SPAWN_CODE_REVIEWER_PROJECT_MERGE_PLAN"
    echo ""
    echo "Common causes:"
    echo "  - Schema validation failure (check pre-commit hook output above)"
    echo "  - Missing required fields in JSON files"
    echo "  - Invalid JSON syntax"
    echo ""
    echo "🛑 Cannot proceed - manual intervention required"
    echo "CONTINUE-SOFTWARE-FACTORY=FALSE REASON=SCHEMA_VALIDATION"
    exit 1
fi

git push || echo "⚠️ WARNING: Push failed - committed locally"
echo "✅ State file committed and pushed"
git push
echo "✅ State file committed and pushed"
```

---

### ✅ Step 6: Save TODOs (R287 - SUPREME LAW)
```bash
# Save TODO state before transition (R287 trigger)
save_todos "SPAWN_CODE_REVIEWER_PROJECT_MERGE_PLAN_COMPLETE"

# Commit TODOs within 60 seconds (R287)
cd "$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR"
git add todos/*.todo

if ! git commit -m "todo: orchestrator - SPAWN_CODE_REVIEWER_PROJECT_MERGE_PLAN complete [R287]"; then
    echo "❌ ERROR: Failed to commit TODO files"
    echo "This is non-fatal but TODOs may be lost in compaction"
    echo "Proceeding with state execution..."
    # Don't exit - TODO commit failure is not fatal
fi

git push || echo "⚠️ WARNING: TODO push failed - committed locally"
echo "✅ TODOs saved and committed"
git push
echo "✅ TODOs saved and committed"
```

---

### ✅ Step 7: Output Continuation Flag (R405 - SUPREME LAW) ⚠️ MANDATORY
```bash
# Output continuation flag as LAST action (R405)
# Use TRUE for normal completion, FALSE only for catastrophic errors

echo "CONTINUE-SOFTWARE-FACTORY=TRUE REASON=STATE_COMPLETE"
```

**⚠️ THIS MUST BE THE ABSOLUTE LAST LINE OF OUTPUT BEFORE EXIT! ⚠️**

---

### ✅ Step 8: Stop Processing (R322 - SUPREME LAW)
```bash
# Stop for context preservation (R322)
echo "🛑 Stopping for context preservation - use /continue-orchestrating to resume"
exit 0
```

---

## 🚨 CHECKLIST ENFORCEMENT 🚨

**Skipping ANY step in this checklist = FAILURE:**
- Missing Step 2: No next state = stuck forever
- Missing Step 3: No state update = state machine broken (R288 violation, -100%)
- Missing Step 4: Invalid state = corruption (R324 violation)
- Missing Step 5: No commit = state lost on compaction (R288 violation, -100%)
- Missing Step 6: No TODO save = work lost (R287 violation, -20% to -100%)
- Missing Step 7: No continuation flag = automation stops (R405 violation, -100%)
- Missing Step 8: No exit = R322 violation (-100%)

**ALL 8 STEPS ARE MANDATORY - NO EXCEPTIONS**

## ✅ EXIT CHECKLIST (R405 - Continuation Flag Protocol) 🔴🔴🔴

**SUPREME LAW - PENALTY FOR VIOLATION: -100% GRADE**


### 🚨 CRITICAL DISTINCTION: AGENT STOPS ≠ FACTORY STOPS 🚨

**TWO INDEPENDENT DECISIONS - DO NOT CONFUSE THEM:**

#### 1. Should Agent Stop Work? (R322 Technical Requirement)
- Agent completes current state
- Agent saves TODOs and commits state
- Agent exits with `exit 0` (preserves context)
- User runs /continue-orchestrating to resume
- **This is NORMAL at checkpoints**

#### 2. Should Factory Continue? (R405 Operational Status)
- Even though agent stopped, can automation proceed?
- TRUE = Healthy completion, automation can continue
- FALSE = Catastrophic failure, must halt everything
- **R322 checkpoints = TRUE (99.9% of cases)**

### THE PATTERN AT R322 CHECKPOINTS (SF 3.0)

```bash
# 1. Complete state work
echo "✅ State work complete"

# 2. Set proposed next state
PROPOSED_NEXT_STATE="WAITING_FOR_PROJECT_MERGE_PLAN"
TRANSITION_REASON="State work complete"

# 3. Spawn State Manager for state transition
/spawn state-manager SHUTDOWN_CONSULTATION \
  --current-state "CURRENT_STATE" \
  --proposed-next-state "$PROPOSED_NEXT_STATE" \
  --transition-reason "$TRANSITION_REASON"
# State Manager updates all 4 state files atomically

# 4. Save TODOs
save_todos "R322_CHECKPOINT"

# 5. Factory continues (operational status)
echo "CONTINUE-SOFTWARE-FACTORY=TRUE REASON=STATE_COMPLETE"

# 6. Agent stops (technical requirement)
exit 0
```

**Both happen together! Agent stops AND factory continues!**

### WHEN TO USE EACH FLAG VALUE

**TRUE (99.9%):**
- ✅ R322 checkpoint reached
- ✅ State work completed successfully
- ✅ Ready for /continue-orchestrating
- ✅ Waiting for user to continue (NORMAL)
- ✅ Plan ready for review (agent done, factory proceeds)

**FALSE (0.1%):**
- ❌ CATASTROPHIC unrecoverable error
- ❌ Data corruption spreading
- ❌ Critical security violation
- ❌ NOT for R322 checkpoints
- ❌ NOT for user review needs
### 🚨 SPAWN STATE PATTERN - R322 + R405 USAGE 🚨

**Spawning operations require R322 stop for context preservation:**
```bash
# After spawning agent(s)
echo "✅ Spawned agents for work"

# R322 checkpoint (context preservation)
echo "🛑 R322: Stopping after spawn for context preservation"

# Flag? → MUST BE TRUE (normal operation!)
echo "CONTINUE-SOFTWARE-FACTORY=TRUE REASON=STATE_COMPLETE"

# Stop inference
exit 0
```

**Why TRUE is correct:**
- Spawning is NORMAL operation
- System knows next state
- Automation can continue
- **Context preservation ≠ manual intervention needed!**
