# Orchestrator - SPAWN_CODE_REVIEWER_FIX_PLAN State Rules

# PRIMARY DIRECTIVES

## 🔴🔴🔴 ABSOLUTE REQUIREMENT: STATE MANAGER CONSULTATION 🔴🔴🔴

**SUPREME LAW - R517 - UNIVERSAL STATE MANAGER CONSULTATION LAW**

**BEFORE EXITING THIS STATE, YOU MUST:**

1. **SPAWN STATE MANAGER FOR SHUTDOWN_CONSULTATION** (MANDATORY - NO EXCEPTIONS)
2. **NEVER UPDATE STATE FILES DIRECTLY** (orchestrator-state-v3.json, bug-tracking.json, etc.)
3. **NEVER COMMIT STATE FILES YOURSELF** (State Manager does this atomically)

**FAILURE TO CONSULT STATE MANAGER = IMMEDIATE SYSTEM HALT (-100% GRADE)**

### Enforcement Mechanism

If you attempt to exit this state without spawning State Manager:
- ❌ Pre-commit hooks will REJECT your commit
- ❌ Validation tools will FAIL the build
- ❌ Grading system will assign -100% penalty
- ❌ System will transition to ERROR_RECOVERY

### Required Pattern (COPY THIS EXACTLY)

```bash
# At end of state work, BEFORE any state file updates:

echo "🔴 MANDATORY: Spawning State Manager for SHUTDOWN_CONSULTATION"

# Spawn State Manager (REQUIRED - NOT OPTIONAL)
# Task: state-manager
# State: SHUTDOWN_CONSULTATION
# Current State: [YOUR_CURRENT_STATE]
# Proposed Next State: [YOUR_PROPOSED_NEXT_STATE]
# Work Summary: [SUMMARY_OF_WORK_COMPLETED]

# State Manager will:
# 1. Validate proposed transition against state machine
# 2. Update all 4 state files atomically
# 3. Commit with [R288] tag
# 4. Return REQUIRED next state (may differ from proposal)

# Wait for State Manager response
# Follow State Manager's directive (REQUIRED next state)
# DO NOT proceed until State Manager confirms
```

**YOU MUST NEVER:**
- ❌ Update orchestrator-state-v3.json yourself
- ❌ Update bug-tracking.json yourself
- ❌ Update integration-containers.json yourself
- ❌ Use `jq` to modify state files
- ❌ Use `sed/awk` to modify state files
- ❌ Set `validated_by: "orchestrator"` (must be "state-manager")
- ❌ Skip State Manager consultation "just this once"
- ❌ Think "I'll validate it manually"

**ONLY State Manager may update state files. This is NON-NEGOTIABLE.**

See: `rule-library/R517-universal-state-manager-consultation-law.md`
You MUST read and acknowledge these rules:

1. **R006** - Orchestrator cannot write code (BLOCKING)

# 🔴🔴🔴 MANDATORY: R322 STOP + R405 CONTINUATION FLAG 🔴🔴🔴

**CRITICAL FOR SPAWN STATES - READ THIS FIRST OR FAIL TEST 2!**

## 🚨 THE PATTERN THAT FAILED TEST 2 🚨

**WHAT HAPPENED IN TEST 2:**
- Orchestrator spawned Code Reviewers ✅ (correct)
- Orchestrator stopped per R322 ✅ (correct)
- Orchestrator **DID NOT emit `CONTINUE-SOFTWARE-FACTORY=TRUE`** ❌ (WRONG!)
- Test framework saw no continuation flag → stopped automation
- Test 2 FAILED at iteration 8

**ROOT CAUSE:** Confusion between R322 "stop" and R405 continuation flag

## 🔴 CRITICAL DISTINCTION: TWO INDEPENDENT DECISIONS 🔴

### Decision 1: Should Agent Stop? (R322 - Context Preservation)
**YES - ALWAYS stop after spawning for context preservation**

- **Purpose**: Prevent context overflow between states
- **Action**: `exit 0` to end conversation
- **User Experience**: User sees "/continue-orchestrating" as next step
- **This is NORMAL!** Not an error!

### Decision 2: Should Factory Continue? (R405 - Automation Control)
**YES - ALWAYS emit TRUE for normal spawning operations**

- **Purpose**: Tell automation whether it CAN restart
- **Action**: `echo "CONTINUE-SOFTWARE-FACTORY=TRUE REASON=STATE_COMPLETE"` (LAST output before exit)
- **Automation**: Framework will auto-restart orchestrator
- **This is NORMAL!** Designed behavior!

## ✅ REQUIRED PATTERN FOR ALL SPAWN STATES

```bash
# 1. Complete spawning work
echo "✅ Spawned [agent type] for [purpose]"

# 2. Update state file per R324/R288
update_state "[NEXT_STATE]"
commit_state_files_per_r288()

# 3. Save TODOs per R287
save_todos "SPAWNED_[AGENT_TYPE]"

# 4. R322: Stop conversation (context preservation)
echo "🛑 R322: Stopping after spawn for context preservation"

# 5. R405: CONTINUATION FLAG - MUST BE TRUE FOR SPAWNING!
echo "CONTINUE-SOFTWARE-FACTORY=TRUE REASON=STATE_COMPLETE"

# 6. Exit to end conversation
exit 0
```

## ❌ WRONG PATTERN (CAUSES TEST FAILURES)

```bash
# ❌ THIS KILLS AUTOMATION - DO NOT DO THIS!
echo "CONTINUE-SOFTWARE-FACTORY=FALSE REASON=MANUAL_INTERVENTION_REQUIRED"
exit 0

# Result: Test framework stops, Test 2 fails at iteration 8
```

## 🎯 WHY TRUE IS CORRECT FOR SPAWNING

**Spawning is NORMAL operation:**
- ✅ System knows next state (from state machine)
- ✅ Automation can continue (designed workflow)
- ✅ No manual intervention needed
- ✅ Context preservation ≠ error condition

**The orchestrator stopping (`exit 0`) is for:**
- Preserving context between conversation turns
- Allowing state file commits
- Creating clean state boundaries

**The TRUE flag indicates:**
- Automation CAN restart the conversation
- System knows what to do next (check state file)
- Normal operation is proceeding

## 🔴 WHEN TO USE FALSE (NOT FOR SPAWNING!)

**FALSE should ONLY be used for catastrophic failures:**
- ❌ State file corrupted beyond parsing
- ❌ Critical infrastructure destroyed
- ❌ Unrecoverable system errors
- ❌ **NEVER for normal spawning operations!**

## 📋 SPAWN STATE CHECKLIST

**Before exiting this spawn state, verify:**
1. [ ] All agents spawned successfully
2. [ ] State file updated to next state per R324
3. [ ] State files committed per R288
4. [ ] TODOs saved per R287
5. [ ] R322 stop message displayed
6. [ ] **CONTINUE-SOFTWARE-FACTORY=TRUE emitted** ← Critical!
7. [ ] Exited with `exit 0`

**Missing step 6 = Test 2 failure = -100% grade**

---


## 🔴🔴🔴 R322 MANDATORY: STOP BEFORE STATE TRANSITIONS 🔴🔴🔴

**CRITICAL REQUIREMENT PER R322:**
After spawning ANY agents in this state, you MUST:
1. Record what was spawned in state file
2. Save TODOs per R287
3. Commit and push state changes
4. Display stop message with continuation instructions
5. EXIT immediately with code 0

**VIOLATION = AUTOMATIC -100% FAILURE**

See: `$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/rule-library/R322-mandatory-stop-before-state-transitions.md`

---


## 🔴🔴🔴 R290 ENFORCEMENT: READ THESE RULES FIRST! 🔴🔴🔴

**SUPREME LAW #3 (R290): STATE RULES MUST BE READ BEFORE STATE ACTIONS**

## 🔴🔴🔴 STOP! STATE RULE READING IS ABSOLUTELY FIRST! 🔴🔴🔴

**YOU HAVE ENTERED SPAWN_CODE_REVIEWER_FIX_PLAN STATE - YOU MUST READ AND ACKNOWLEDGE ALL STATE RULES BEFORE DOING ANY STATE WORK!**

## 🔴🔴🔴 R290 VERIFICATION REQUIREMENT 🔴🔴🔴

**R290 ENFORCEMENT: CREATE VERIFICATION MARKER AFTER READING**

After reading and acknowledging all state rules, you MUST create a verification marker:

```bash
# MANDATORY: Create verification marker after reading rules
mkdir -p markers/state-verification && touch "markers/state-verification/state_rules_read_orchestrator_SPAWN_CODE_REVIEWER_FIX_PLAN-$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S)"
echo "$(date +%s) - Rules read and acknowledged for SPAWN_CODE_REVIEWER_FIX_PLAN" > "markers/state-verification/state_rules_read_orchestrator_SPAWN_CODE_REVIEWER_FIX_PLAN-$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S)"
```

**FAILURE TO CREATE MARKER = AUTOMATIC -100% PENALTY**

The system will check for this marker. No marker = Immediate failure.

### ❌ DO NOT DO ANY SPAWNING WORK UNTIL RULES ARE READ:
- ❌ Prepare fix plan requests
- ❌ Create command files
- ❌ Spawn Code Reviewer agents
- ❌ Update state files
- ❌ Continue to next state
- ❌ Think about what to do in this state

### ✅ YOU MUST IMMEDIATELY:

## 🔴🔴🔴 MANDATORY STATE RULE READING AND ACKNOWLEDGMENT 🔴🔴🔴

### 🛑 RULE R322 - Mandatory Stop Before State Transitions
**Source:** $CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/rule-library/R322-mandatory-stop-before-state-transitions.md
**Criticality:** 🔴🔴🔴 SUPREME LAW - Violation = -100% FAILURE

After completing state work and committing state file:
1. STOP IMMEDIATELY
2. Do NOT continue to next state
3. Do NOT start new work
4. Exit and wait for user

8. Read: $CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/rule-library/R206-state-machine-transition-validation.md

**WE ARE WATCHING EACH READ TOOL CALL**

### ❌ ANTI-PATTERNS THAT WILL CAUSE FAILURE:

1. **Fake Acknowledgment Without Reading**:
   ```
   ❌ WRONG: "I acknowledge R234, R208, R290..."
   (No Read tool calls detected = AUTOMATIC FAILURE)
   ```

2. **Bulk Acknowledgment**:
   ```
   ❌ WRONG: "I acknowledge all SPAWN_CODE_REVIEWER_FIX_PLAN rules"
   (YOU Must READ AND ACKNOWLEDGE EACH rule individually)
   ```

3. **Silent Reading**:
   ```
   ❌ WRONG: [Reads rules but doesn't acknowledge]
   "Now I've read the rules, let me start work..."
   (MUST explicitly acknowledge EACH rule)
   ```

4. **Reading From Memory**:
   ```
   ❌ WRONG: "I know R239 requires fix plan distribution..."
   (Must READ from file, not recall from memory)
   ```

### ✅ CORRECT PATTERN FOR SPAWN_CODE_REVIEWER_FIX_PLAN:
```
1. READ: $CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/rule-library/R234-mandatory-state-traversal-supreme-law.md
2. "I acknowledge R234 - Mandatory State Traversal: [Brief description]"
3. READ: $CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/rule-library/R006-orchestrator-never-writes-code.md  
4. "I acknowledge R006 - Orchestrator Never Writes Code: [Brief description]"
### 🚨 NO WORK UNTIL ACKNOWLEDGMENT COMPLETE 🚨
**You may NOT begin ANY SPAWN_CODE_REVIEWER_FIX_PLAN work until:**
### 🚨 FAILURE TO READ STATE RULES FIRST = IMMEDIATE EXIT 🚨
**If you do ANY SPAWN_CODE_REVIEWER_FIX_PLAN work before reading and acknowledging rules:**
- **STOP ALL WORK IMMEDIATELY**
- **EXIT WITH FAILURE STATUS**
- **YOU HAVE VIOLATED STATE COMPLIANCE**

**After reading ALL rules, acknowledge them:**
□ I have read R234 - Mandatory State Traversal (SUPREME LAW #1)
□ I have read R208 - No Implementation in Orchestrator (SUPREME LAW #2)
□ I have read R290 - State Rule Reading and Verification (SUPREME LAW #3)
□ I have read R239 - Fix Plan Distribution Protocol
□ I have read R219 - Code Reviewer Dependency-Aware Planning
□ I have read R006 - Orchestrator Never Writes Code
□ I have read R206 - State Machine Transition Validation

**CRITICAL**: You must have made 8 actual Read tool calls. Count them!

## 🔴🔴🔴 SUPREME DIRECTIVE: CREATE FIX PLANS FOR FAILED INTEGRATE_WAVE_EFFORTSS 🔴🔴🔴

**SPAWN CODE REVIEWER TO ANALYZE AND CREATE FIX PLANS!**

## State Overview

In SPAWN_CODE_REVIEWER_FIX_PLAN, you spawn a Code Reviewer agent to analyze integration failures and create detailed fix plans for engineers.

## Required Actions

### 1. Prepare Fix Plan Request
```bash
PHASE=$(jq '.project_progression.current_phase.phase_number' orchestrator-state-v3.json)
WAVE=$(jq '.project_progression.current_wave.wave_number' orchestrator-state-v3.json)
FIX_REQUEST_FILE=$(jq ".integration_feedback.wave${WAVE}.fix_request_file" orchestrator-state-v3.json)
TIMESTAMP=$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S)

# Create fix plan workspace
FIX_PLAN_DIR="efforts/phase${PHASE}/wave${WAVE}/fix-plans"
mkdir -p "$FIX_PLAN_DIR"

echo "📋 Preparing fix plan request for Code Reviewer"
```

### 2. Spawn Code Reviewer for Fix Planning
```bash
# Create command file for Code Reviewer
COMMAND_FILE="${FIX_PLAN_DIR}/code-reviewer-fix-plan-command.md"

cat > "$COMMAND_FILE" << 'EOF'
# CODE REVIEWER FIX PLAN CREATION TASK

## Your State
You are in state: CREATE_FIX_PLAN

## Integration Failure Analysis Required

1. **Read the integration report**: 
   - Location: `efforts/phaseX/waveY/integration-workspace/INTEGRATE_WAVE_EFFORTS_REPORT.md`
   
2. **Read the fix request metadata**:
   - Location: `efforts/phaseX/waveY/FIX_REQUEST_*.yaml`

3. **For each failed effort, create a fix plan**:
   - Analyze the specific failure
   - Determine root cause
   - Create step-by-step fix instructions
   - Include dependency installation if needed
   - Specify test commands to verify fixes

4. **Output Format**:
   Create: `efforts/phaseX/waveY/fix-plans/FIX_PLAN_[effort].md`
   
   ```markdown
   # Fix Plan for [Effort Name]
   
   ## Issue Summary
   [Brief description of what failed]
   
   ## Root Cause
   [Analysis of why it failed]
   
   ## Fix Instructions
   1. [Step 1]
   2. [Step 2]
   ...
   
   ## Verification Steps
   1. Run: `[test command]`
   2. Verify: [what to check]
   
   ## Dependencies to Install (if any)
   - [dependency 1]
   - [dependency 2]
   ```

5. **Create summary file**: `FIX_PLAN_SUMMARY.yaml`
   ```yaml
   fix_plans_created:
     - effort: effort1
       plan_file: FIX_PLAN_effort1.md
       estimated_time: 30m
     - effort: effort2
       plan_file: FIX_PLAN_effort2.md
       estimated_time: 45m
   total_efforts: 2
   timestamp: [ISO timestamp]
   ```

Remember: You are NOT executing fixes, only creating the plans!
EOF

# Replace placeholders
sed -i "s/phaseX/phase${PHASE}/g" "$COMMAND_FILE"
sed -i "s/waveY/wave${WAVE}/g" "$COMMAND_FILE"

echo "✅ Command file created: $COMMAND_FILE"

# Spawn the Code Reviewer
echo "🚀 Spawning Code Reviewer for fix plan creation"
echo "@agent-code-reviewer Please execute the task in: $COMMAND_FILE"
```

### 3. Update State File
```bash
# Record spawning
jq ".agents_spawned += [{\"type\": \"code-reviewer\", \"task\": \"create_fix_plans\", \"state\": \"CREATE_FIX_PLAN\", \"timestamp\": \"$(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)\", \"command_file\": \"$COMMAND_FILE\"}]" -i orchestrator-state-v3.json

# Update current state
jq ".integration_feedback.wave${WAVE}.fix_plan_requested = \"$(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)\"" -i orchestrator-state-v3.json

# Commit
git add orchestrator-state-v3.json "$COMMAND_FILE"
git commit -m "spawn: Code Reviewer for integration fix plans - wave ${WAVE}"
git push
```

## Valid Transitions

1. **ALWAYS**: `SPAWN_CODE_REVIEWER_FIX_PLAN` → `WAITING_FOR_FIX_PLANS`
   - Transition immediately after spawning

## Spawn Requirements

The Code Reviewer MUST be given:
- Access to integration report
- Fix request metadata file
- Clear output location for fix plans
- Instructions NOT to execute fixes

## Grading Criteria

- ✅ **+25%**: Create proper command file
- ✅ **+25%**: Include all failure information
- ✅ **+25%**: Spawn Code Reviewer correctly
- ✅ **+25%**: Update state file properly

## Common Violations

- ❌ **-100%**: Not spawning Code Reviewer
- ❌ **-50%**: Missing integration report reference
- ❌ **-50%**: Asking Code Reviewer to execute fixes
- ❌ **-30%**: Not creating fix plan directory



## 🔴🔴🔴 STATE COMPLETION CHECKLIST 🔴🔴🔴

**Execute these steps IN ORDER to properly complete SPAWN_CODE_REVIEWER_FIX_PLAN:**

### ✅ Step 1: Complete State-Specific Work
**Refer to "Primary Actions" and "Mandatory Validations" sections above for state-specific tasks.**

Once all state work is complete, proceed to mandatory exit protocol:

---

### ✅ Step 2: Set Proposed Next State and Transition Reason
```bash
# Based on state work results, determine proposed next state
PROPOSED_NEXT_STATE="[DETERMINE_FROM_STATE_LOGIC]"
TRANSITION_REASON="SPAWN_CODE_REVIEWER_FIX_PLAN complete - [describe what was accomplished]"
echo "Proposed next state: $PROPOSED_NEXT_STATE"
echo "Transition reason: $TRANSITION_REASON"
```

---

### ✅ Step 3: Spawn State Manager for SHUTDOWN_CONSULTATION
```bash
# State Manager validates transition and updates state files (SF 3.0 Pattern)
echo "🔄 Spawning State Manager for SHUTDOWN_CONSULTATION..."

# Prepare work results summary
WORK_RESULTS=$(cat <<EOF
{
  "state_completed": "SPAWN_CODE_REVIEWER_FIX_PLAN",
  "work_accomplished": [
    "[List accomplishments from state work]"
  ],
  "proposed_next_state": "$PROPOSED_NEXT_STATE",
  "transition_reason": "$TRANSITION_REASON"
}
EOF
)

# Spawn State Manager
/spawn state-manager SHUTDOWN_CONSULTATION \
  --current-state "SPAWN_CODE_REVIEWER_FIX_PLAN" \
  --proposed-next-state "$PROPOSED_NEXT_STATE" \
  --transition-reason "$TRANSITION_REASON" \
  --work-results "$WORK_RESULTS"

# State Manager will:
# 1. Validate PROPOSED_NEXT_STATE exists and transition is valid
# 2. Update all 4 state files atomically (R288)
# 3. Commit and push state files
# 4. Return REQUIRED_NEXT_STATE (usually same as proposed unless invalid)

echo "✅ State Manager consultation complete"
echo "✅ State files updated by State Manager"
```

---

### ✅ Step 4: Save TODOs (R287 - SUPREME LAW)
```bash
# Save TODO state before transition (R287 trigger)
save_todos "SPAWN_CODE_REVIEWER_FIX_PLAN_COMPLETE"

# Commit TODOs within 60 seconds (R287)
cd "$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR"
git add todos/*.todo

if ! git commit -m "todo: orchestrator - SPAWN_CODE_REVIEWER_FIX_PLAN complete [R287]"; then
    echo "❌ ERROR: Failed to commit TODO files"
    echo "This is non-fatal but TODOs may be lost in compaction"
    echo "Proceeding with state execution..."
    # Don't exit - TODO commit failure is not fatal
fi

git push || echo "⚠️ WARNING: TODO push failed - committed locally"
echo "✅ TODOs saved and committed"
git push
echo "✅ TODOs saved and committed"
```

---

### ✅ Step 5: Output Continuation Flag (R405 - SUPREME LAW) ⚠️ MANDATORY
```bash
# Output continuation flag as LAST action (R405)
# Use TRUE for normal completion, FALSE only for catastrophic errors

echo "CONTINUE-SOFTWARE-FACTORY=TRUE REASON=STATE_COMPLETE"
```

**⚠️ THIS MUST BE THE ABSOLUTE LAST LINE OF OUTPUT BEFORE EXIT! ⚠️**

---

### ✅ Step 6: Stop Processing (R322 - SUPREME LAW)
```bash
# Stop for context preservation (R322)
echo "🛑 Stopping for context preservation - use /continue-orchestrating to resume"
exit 0
```

---

## 🚨 CHECKLIST ENFORCEMENT 🚨

**Skipping ANY step in this checklist = FAILURE:**
- Missing Step 2: No next state = stuck forever
- Missing Step 3: No state update = state machine broken (R288 violation, -100%)
- Missing Step 4: Invalid state = corruption (R324 violation)
- Missing Step 5: No commit = state lost on compaction (R288 violation, -100%)
- Missing Step 6: No TODO save = work lost (R287 violation, -20% to -100%)
- Missing Step 7: No continuation flag = automation stops (R405 violation, -100%)
- Missing Step 8: No exit = R322 violation (-100%)

- Missing Step 2: No proposed next state = State Manager can't proceed
- Missing Step 3: No State Manager consultation = bypassing bookend pattern (-100%)
- Missing Step 4: No TODO save = work lost (R287 violation, -20% to -100%)
- Missing Step 5: No continuation flag = automation stops (R405 violation, -100%)
- Missing Step 6: No exit = R322 violation (-100%)

**ALL 6 STEPS ARE MANDATORY - NO EXCEPTIONS**
**NOTE**: State file validation and commits now handled by State Manager (SF 3.0 pattern) - NO EXCEPTIONS**

## ✅ EXIT CHECKLIST (R405 - Continuation Flag Protocol) 🔴🔴🔴

**SUPREME LAW - PENALTY FOR VIOLATION: -100% GRADE**


### 🚨 CRITICAL DISTINCTION: AGENT STOPS ≠ FACTORY STOPS 🚨

**TWO INDEPENDENT DECISIONS - DO NOT CONFUSE THEM:**

#### 1. Should Agent Stop Work? (R322 Technical Requirement)
- Agent completes current state
- Agent saves TODOs and commits state
- Agent exits with `exit 0` (preserves context)
- User runs /continue-orchestrating to resume
- **This is NORMAL at checkpoints**

#### 2. Should Factory Continue? (R405 Operational Status)
- Even though agent stopped, can automation proceed?
- TRUE = Healthy completion, automation can continue
- FALSE = Catastrophic failure, must halt everything
- **R322 checkpoints = TRUE (99.9% of cases)**

### THE PATTERN AT R322 CHECKPOINTS (SF 3.0)

```bash
# 1. Complete state work
echo "✅ State work complete"

# 2. Set proposed next state
PROPOSED_NEXT_STATE="WAITING_FOR_FIX_PLANS"
TRANSITION_REASON="State work complete"

# 3. Spawn State Manager for state transition
/spawn state-manager SHUTDOWN_CONSULTATION \
  --current-state "CURRENT_STATE" \
  --proposed-next-state "$PROPOSED_NEXT_STATE" \
  --transition-reason "$TRANSITION_REASON"
# State Manager updates all 4 state files atomically

# 4. Save TODOs
save_todos "R322_CHECKPOINT"

# 5. Factory continues (operational status)
echo "CONTINUE-SOFTWARE-FACTORY=TRUE REASON=STATE_COMPLETE"

# 6. Agent stops (technical requirement)
exit 0
```

**Both happen together! Agent stops AND factory continues!**

### WHEN TO USE EACH FLAG VALUE

**TRUE (99.9%):**
- ✅ R322 checkpoint reached
- ✅ State work completed successfully
- ✅ Ready for /continue-orchestrating
- ✅ Waiting for user to continue (NORMAL)
- ✅ Plan ready for review (agent done, factory proceeds)

**FALSE (0.1%):**
- ❌ CATASTROPHIC unrecoverable error
- ❌ Data corruption spreading
- ❌ Critical security violation
- ❌ NOT for R322 checkpoints
- ❌ NOT for user review needs
### 🚨 SPAWN STATE PATTERN - R322 + R405 USAGE 🚨

**Spawning operations require R322 stop for context preservation:**
```bash
# After spawning agent(s)
echo "✅ Spawned agents for work"

# R322 checkpoint (context preservation)
echo "🛑 R322: Stopping after spawn for context preservation"

# Flag? → MUST BE TRUE (normal operation!)
echo "CONTINUE-SOFTWARE-FACTORY=TRUE REASON=STATE_COMPLETE"

# Stop inference
exit 0
```

**Why TRUE is correct:**
- Spawning is NORMAL operation
- System knows next state
- Automation can continue
- **Context preservation ≠ manual intervention needed!**
**See: $CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/rule-library/R405-automation-continuation-flag.md**


## Related Rules

- R239: Fix Plan Distribution Protocol
- R219: Code Reviewer Dependency-Aware Planning
- R006: Orchestrator Never Writes Code
- R206: State Machine Transition Validation

## 🔴🔴🔴 MANDATORY MEASUREMENT RULE - R304 🔴🔴🔴

**ABSOLUTE REQUIREMENTS:**
- ✅ MUST use `$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/tools/line-counter.sh` for ALL line counting
- ❌ NEVER use `wc -l` or any manual counting method
- ❌ NEVER count lines any other way - this is a -100% automatic failure
- ✅ MUST specify both -b (base branch) and -c (current branch) parameters
- ✅ Base branch MUST be phase integration branch (NOT "main")

**Failure to use the line counter tool = AUTOMATIC -100% GRADE**

## R322 VIOLATION DETECTION

If you find yourself:
- Starting work for a new state without /continue-orchestrating
- Transitioning without stopping after state file commit
- Continuing after completing state work

**STOP IMMEDIATELY - You are violating R322!**


### 🔴🔴🔴 MANDATORY VALIDATION REQUIREMENT 🔴🔴🔴

**Per R288 and R324**: ALL state file updates MUST be validated before commit:

```bash
# After ANY update to orchestrator-state-v3.json:
"$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/tools/validate-state.sh" orchestrator-state-v3.json || {
    echo "❌ State file validation failed!"
    exit 288
}
```

**Use helper functions for automatic validation:**
```bash
# Source the helper functions
source "$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/utilities/state-file-update-functions.sh"

# Use safe functions that include validation:
safe_state_transition "NEW_STATE" "reason"
safe_update_field "field_name" "value"
```
