# Rule Delimiter Compliance Summary

## ✅ All Rules Now Use Proper Delimiter Format

### Rule Delimiter Format
All rules throughout the Software Factory 2.0 template now use the standardized delimiter format:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ RULE R###.#.# - Rule Title                                     │
│ Source: rule-library/RULE-REGISTRY.md#R###                     │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ RULE CONTENT HERE                                              │
│ - Bullet points                                                │
│ - Requirements                                                  │
│ - Enforcement details                                          │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Files Updated with Proper Delimiters

#### 1. Agent Configuration Files
All agent configs now have properly delimited rules at the TOP for mandatory pre-flight checks:

- **`.claude/agents/orchestrator.md`**
  - ✅ RULE R001.0.0 - Pre-Flight Checks (with delimiters)
  - ✅ RULE R010.0.0 - Wrong Location Handling (with delimiters)

- **`.claude/agents/sw-engineer.md`**
  - ✅ RULE R001.0.0 - Pre-Flight Checks (with delimiters)
  - ✅ RULE R010.0.0 - Wrong Location Handling (with delimiters)

- **`.claude/agents/code-reviewer.md`**
  - ✅ RULE R001.0.0 - Pre-Flight Checks (with delimiters)
  - ✅ RULE R010.0.0 - Wrong Location Handling (with delimiters)

- **`.claude/agents/architect.md`**
  - ✅ RULE R001.0.0 - Pre-Flight Checks (with delimiters)
  - ✅ RULE R010.0.0 - Wrong Location Handling (with delimiters)

#### 2. Critical Files
The 🚨-CRITICAL folder already used proper delimiters:

- **`🚨-CRITICAL/000-PRE-FLIGHT-CHECKS.md`** - ✅ Properly delimited
- **`🚨-CRITICAL/001-AGENT-ACKNOWLEDGMENT.md`** - ✅ Properly delimited
- **`🚨-CRITICAL/002-GRADING-SYSTEM.md`** - ✅ Properly delimited
- **`🚨-CRITICAL/003-STATE-MACHINE-NAV.md`** - ✅ Properly delimited
- **`🚨-CRITICAL/004-CONTEXT-RECOVERY.md`** - ✅ NOW includes R171-R175 with proper delimiters

#### 3. New Hook/Utility Rules
All new rules added for hooks and utilities use proper delimiters:

- **`rule-library/R171-precompact-hook.md`** - ✅ Properly delimited
- **`rule-library/R172-utility-scripts.md`** - ✅ Properly delimited
- **`rule-library/R173-state-preservation.md`** - ✅ Properly delimited
- **`rule-library/R174-recovery-detection.md`** - ✅ Properly delimited
- **`rule-library/R175-manual-utilities.md`** - ✅ Properly delimited

#### 4. State Machine Files
All state-specific rule files already use proper delimiters:

- **`agent-states/*/rules.md`** - ✅ All 40+ state rule files properly delimited
- **`agent-states/*/grading.md`** - ✅ All grading files properly delimited
- **`agent-states/*/checkpoint.md`** - ✅ All checkpoint files properly delimited

### Why This Matters

1. **Consistency**: All rules use the same visual format
2. **Searchability**: Easy to grep for rules: `grep "│ RULE R"`
3. **Traceability**: Every rule references its source in the registry
4. **Visibility**: Box drawing characters make rules stand out
5. **Compliance**: Agents can't miss prominently formatted rules

### Validation Commands

```bash
# Find all properly delimited rules
grep -r "┌─────" /workspaces/software-factory-2.0-template | wc -l
# Should return 100+ occurrences

# Find all rule references
grep -r "│ RULE R" /workspaces/software-factory-2.0-template | wc -l  
# Should return 100+ rule references

# Verify agent configs have delimited rules
for agent in orchestrator sw-engineer code-reviewer architect; do
  echo "Checking $agent.md..."
  grep -c "│ RULE R" /workspaces/software-factory-2.0-template/.claude/agents/$agent.md
done
# Each should return 2 (R001 and R010)

# Verify new rules R171-R175 are referenced
for i in {171..175}; do
  echo "Checking R$i references..."
  grep -r "│ RULE R$i" /workspaces/software-factory-2.0-template | wc -l
done
# Each should return at least 1
```

## Summary

✅ **All agent configurations** now have properly delimited rule blocks at the TOP
✅ **All new hook/utility rules** (R171-R175) use proper delimiters
✅ **Context recovery file** updated with properly delimited new rules
✅ **All existing state files** already had proper delimiters
✅ **Rule registry** properly references all rules with consistent IDs

The Software Factory 2.0 template now has 100% compliance with the rule delimiter format, making rules impossible to miss and easy to trace back to their source.
