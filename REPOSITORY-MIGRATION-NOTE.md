# Repository Migration Note

**Date**: 2025-09-15
**Status**: COMPLETED

## Summary

The project integration has been successfully migrated from the Software Factory repository to the correct target repository.

## Migration Details

### Original (Incorrect) Location
- Repository: https://github.com/jessesanford/idpbuilder-oci-build-push.git (SF repo)
- Branch: idpbuilder-oci-build-push/project-integration
- Path: /worktrees/project-integration

### New (Correct) Location
- Repository: https://github.com/jessesanford/idpbuilder.git (Target repo)
- Branch: idpbuilder-oci-build-push/project-integration
- Path: /home/vscode/workspaces/idpbuilder-oci-build-push/worktrees/target-repo-integration

## What Was Migrated

All implementation code from Phases 1 and 2:
- Certificate validation features (pkg/certs/, pkg/certvalidation/)
- OCI build/push features (pkg/oci/, pkg/registry/, pkg/build/)
- Gitea integration (pkg/gitea/)
- CLI commands (pkg/cmd/build.go, pkg/cmd/push.go)
- Demo scripts
- Updated go.mod and go.sum

## Current Status

✅ Code successfully pushed to target repository
✅ Branch available at: https://github.com/jessesanford/idpbuilder/tree/idpbuilder-oci-build-push/project-integration
✅ Ready for pull request creation
✅ orchestrator-state.json updated with correct repository information

## Action Required

The old worktree at `/worktrees/project-integration` in the SF repo can be:
1. Deleted (recommended) - it served its purpose for development
2. Kept for reference - but should not be used for further development

## Lessons Learned

Future efforts MUST:
1. Clone the target repository (not SF repo)
2. Create worktrees from target repository
3. Verify repository URL before starting work
4. Keep SF repo for planning/orchestration only
