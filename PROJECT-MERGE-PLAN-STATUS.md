# PROJECT MERGE PLAN STATUS

## ✅ MERGE PLAN CREATION COMPLETE

**Agent**: Code Reviewer (PROJECT_MERGE_PLANNING state)
**Timestamp**: 2025-09-09 06:21:00 UTC
**Status**: SUCCESS

## 📍 Plan Location
`/home/vscode/workspaces/idpbuilder-oci-build-push/efforts/project/integration-workspace/PROJECT-MERGE-PLAN.md`

## 📊 Summary
- **Phase 1 Integration**: Ready to merge (+9,319 lines)
- **Phase 2 Wave 1**: 2 efforts ready to merge (+4,622 lines total)
  - E2.1.1 image-builder
  - E2.1.2 gitea-client
- **Total Integration Size**: ~13,000+ lines

## 🔄 Merge Sequence (R270 Compliant)
1. Create Phase 2 Wave 1 integration branch (merge both efforts)
2. Merge Phase 1 integration to project-integration
3. Merge Phase 2 Wave 1 integration to project-integration
4. Run full test suite and validation

## ⚠️ Risk Assessment
- **Phase 1 Merge**: LOW risk (first major merge, clean base)
- **Phase 2 Wave 1 Creation**: LOW risk (minimal overlap between efforts)
- **Phase 2 Wave 1 Merge**: MEDIUM risk (depends on Phase 1 components)

## 📝 Key Deliverables
- ✅ Comprehensive PROJECT-MERGE-PLAN.md created
- ✅ Merge sequence with exact commands documented
- ✅ Conflict resolution strategy defined
- ✅ Testing checkpoints specified
- ✅ Contingency plans for all scenarios
- ✅ Post-merge tasks documented

## 🚀 Next Steps
1. Orchestrator should spawn Integration Agent
2. Integration Agent should execute PROJECT-MERGE-PLAN.md step by step
3. All merges should be validated with tests
4. Final integration should be tagged

## 📌 Important Notes
- Phase 2 Wave 1 integration branch needs to be created first
- All merges use --no-ff for clear history
- Each merge has validation checkpoints
- Rollback capability maintained with separate commits
