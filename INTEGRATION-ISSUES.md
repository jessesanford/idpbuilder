# Phase 1 Integration Issues - Requiring Backport Fixes

## Critical Build Failures (R321 - Must Fix in Source Branches)

### 1. pkg/controllers/custompackage
**Issue**: Test failure
**Error**: TestReconcileCustomPkg fails
**Impact**: Controller functionality compromised
**Required Fix Location**: Source effort branches that implement controllers

### 2. pkg/controllers/localbuild
**Issue**: Build failure
**Error**: Package fails to compile
**Impact**: Local build controller non-functional
**Required Fix Location**: Source effort branches that implement controllers

### 3. pkg/kind
**Issue**: Build failure
**Error**: Package fails to compile
**Impact**: Kind cluster integration broken
**Required Fix Location**: Source effort branches that implement kind integration

### 4. pkg/util
**Issue**: Build failure
**Error**: Package fails to compile
**Impact**: Utility functions unavailable
**Required Fix Location**: Source effort branches that implement utilities

## R321 Protocol Requirements

Per R321 (Immediate Backport During Integration), these issues must be:
1. Fixed in the original effort branches
2. Re-integrated through the cascade (Wave 1 → Wave 2 → Phase 1)
3. NO fixes should be made directly in this integration branch

## Severity Assessment

**HIGH PRIORITY**:
- pkg/util - Core utility package affects many other packages
- pkg/kind - Critical for local development with Kind clusters

**MEDIUM PRIORITY**:
- pkg/controllers/* - Controller functionality important but isolated

## Recommendation for SW Engineers

1. Start with pkg/util fixes as it may resolve other issues
2. Check for missing imports or circular dependencies
3. Ensure all required dependencies are in go.mod
4. Verify test infrastructure requirements for controllers

## Integration Status
Integration cannot be considered complete until these issues are resolved through proper R321 backport process.
