# Software Factory 2.0 - Hooks & Utilities Final Summary

## ✅ All Issues Resolved

### 1. Pre-Flight Checks Now Mandatory
**Problem:** Agents were not performing their mandatory pre-flight checks.
**Solution:** Added prominent pre-flight check sections at the TOP of each agent configuration file that include `exit 1` on failure.

**Files Updated:**
- `.claude/agents/orchestrator.md` - Added 55-line pre-flight check section
- `.claude/agents/sw-engineer.md` - Added 65-line pre-flight check section  
- `.claude/agents/code-reviewer.md` - Added 60-line pre-flight check section
- `.claude/agents/architect.md` - Added 60-line pre-flight check section

Each agent now MUST:
1. Print startup timestamp and identity
2. Verify correct working directory (exit if wrong)
3. Check for required files (exit if missing)
4. Verify Git branch pattern (exit if wrong)
5. Check Git status and remote configuration

### 2. Hooks vs Utilities Clarified
**Problem:** Template incorrectly assumed Claude Code supported many fictional hooks.
**Solution:** Renamed `hooks/` to `utilities/` to accurately reflect that these are manual scripts.

**Reality Check:**
- Claude Code only supports: PreCompact, PreToolUse, PostToolUse hooks
- SF 2.0 only uses: PreCompact (configured inline in settings.json)
- All other scripts are manual utilities, not automatic hooks

**Files Updated:**
- Renamed directory: `hooks/` → `utilities/`
- Updated `setup.sh` - Removed duplicate chmod references to old hooks/
- Updated `migrate-from-1.0.sh` - Changed all hooks/ references to utilities/
- Updated `verify-installation.sh` - Changed all hooks/ references to utilities/
- Updated `utilities/pre-compact.sh` - Fixed internal references

### 3. Rules Properly Documented
**Problem:** Hook and utility usage rules were not in the rule registry.
**Solution:** Added comprehensive rules R171-R175 to the rule library.

**New Rules:**
- **R171.0.0** - PreCompact Hook Configuration (the ONLY automatic hook)
- **R172.0.0** - Utility Script Execution (manual scripts, not hooks)
- **R173.0.0** - State Preservation Protocol (dual approach)
- **R174.0.0** - Context Recovery Detection (compaction marker)
- **R175.0.0** - Manual Utility Usage (explicit execution required)

**Documentation:**
- Created `rule-library/R171-precompact-hook.md` through `R175-manual-utilities.md`
- Created `rule-library/HOOK-RULES-SUMMARY.md` for quick reference
- Updated `rule-library/RULE-REGISTRY.md` with all new rules

### 4. Settings.json Corrected
**Problem:** Settings.json referenced fictional hooks and incorrect paths.
**Solution:** Replaced with accurate PreCompact-only configuration.

**Current `.claude/settings.json`:**
```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "PreCompact": [{
      "matcher": "auto",
      "hooks": [{
        "type": "command",
        "command": "echo '=== AUTO-COMPACTION TRIGGERED ===' && date && echo 'Creating marker file...' && echo \"COMPACTION_TIME=$(date '+%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S %Z')\" > /tmp/compaction_marker.txt && echo 'Marker created at /tmp/compaction_marker.txt'"
      }]
    }]
  }
}
```

## Testing Checklist

### Pre-Flight Checks
```bash
# Test that agents fail on wrong directory
cd /tmp
# Try to run orchestrator - should fail with exit 1

# Test that agents fail on wrong branch
git checkout -b wrong-branch
# Try to run SW engineer - should fail with exit 1
```

### Utilities (Manual Scripts)
```bash
# These must be run manually:
./utilities/pre-compact.sh        # Manual state save
./utilities/state-snapshot.sh     # Create checkpoint
./utilities/recovery-assistant.sh # Help with recovery
./utilities/todo-preservation.sh  # Save TODOs
```

### Hook (Automatic)
```bash
# PreCompact runs automatically before context compaction
# Test by checking for marker after compaction:
ls -la /tmp/compaction_marker.txt
```

## Key Takeaways

1. **Pre-flight checks are now unavoidable** - Embedded at top of each agent config with failure exits
2. **Only PreCompact is automatic** - Everything else is a manual utility script
3. **No fictional hooks** - Template now accurately reflects Claude Code capabilities
4. **Rules are comprehensive** - R171-R175 cover all aspects of hooks and utilities
5. **Setup scripts are fixed** - No more errors about missing hooks/ directory

## Validation Commands

```bash
# Verify utilities directory exists
ls -la utilities/

# Verify hooks directory does NOT exist  
ls -la hooks/ 2>&1 | grep "No such file"

# Check PreCompact hook is configured
grep -c "PreCompact" .claude/settings.json  # Should be >0

# Verify no references to fictional hooks
grep -c "post_compact" .claude/settings.json  # Should be 0

# Test compaction marker detection
echo "TEST" > /tmp/compaction_marker.txt
# Agents should detect and report this on next startup
```

## Status: COMPLETE ✅

All requested fixes have been implemented:
- Pre-flight checks are prominent and mandatory
- Hooks vs utilities distinction is correct
- All rules are in the registry
- Setup scripts work without errors
- Documentation accurately reflects reality
