# üìä DEMO INTEGRATION ANALYSIS REPORT

**Date**: 2025-09-11  
**Analyst**: software-factory-manager  
**Purpose**: Ensure demo requirements are properly integrated with new integration states

## üîç EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

### Demo Rules Found
- **R330**: Demo Planning Requirements (BLOCKING) - Requires explicit demo planning in every effort plan
- **R291**: Integration Demo Requirement (BLOCKING) - Enforces build/test/demo gates at every integration level

### Key Findings
‚úÖ **GOOD**: Demo gates are already enforced in MONITORING_INTEGRATION state  
‚úÖ **GOOD**: R291 triggers ERROR_RECOVERY if demos fail  
‚ö†Ô∏è **GAP**: Merge planning states don't explicitly require demo scenario planning  
‚ö†Ô∏è **GAP**: Integration code review states don't verify demo quality  
‚ö†Ô∏è **GAP**: Integration agent TESTING state doesn't explicitly run demos

## üìã DETAILED ANALYSIS

### 1. Existing Demo Rules

#### R330: Demo Planning Requirements
- **Scope**: Every effort plan MUST include demo requirements
- **Requirements**:
  - 3-5 specific demonstration objectives
  - 2-4 exact scenarios with commands
  - Size impact calculation (demos count toward 800-line limit)
  - Demo deliverables list (scripts, docs, data)
- **Enforcement**: Code Reviewer during EFFORT_PLAN_CREATION
- **Penalty**: -25% to -50% for violations

#### R291: Integration Demo Requirement
- **Scope**: Every integration (wave/phase/project) MUST demo
- **Gates Enforced**:
  1. BUILD GATE: Must compile successfully
  2. TEST GATE: All tests must pass
  3. DEMO GATE: Demo script must execute successfully
  4. ARTIFACT GATE: Build outputs must exist
- **Enforcement**: MONITORING_INTEGRATION state checks all gates
- **Failure Action**: Immediate transition to ERROR_RECOVERY
- **Penalty**: -50% to -75% for violations, -100% for marking complete without demos

### 2. Coverage in New Integration States

#### ‚úÖ STATES WITH GOOD DEMO COVERAGE:

**MONITORING_INTEGRATION**
- Explicitly checks DEMO_STATUS from integration report
- Enforces R291 demo gate
- Transitions to ERROR_RECOVERY if demo fails
- **Status**: FULLY COMPLIANT ‚úÖ

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è STATES MISSING EXPLICIT DEMO REQUIREMENTS:

**WAVE_MERGE_PLANNING (Code Reviewer)**
- Creates merge plan but doesn't mention demo integration planning
- **GAP**: Should require demo execution order in merge plan
- **GAP**: Should identify which demos run at what point

**INTEGRATION_CODE_REVIEW**
- Reviews integrated code quality
- **GAP**: Should verify demo scripts are present and executable
- **GAP**: Should check demo coverage of integrated features

**PHASE_INTEGRATION_CODE_REVIEW**
- Reviews phase-level integration
- **GAP**: Should verify phase-level demo orchestration
- **GAP**: Should check demo comprehensiveness

**PROJECT_INTEGRATION_CODE_REVIEW**
- Reviews project-level integration
- **GAP**: Should verify end-to-end demo scenarios
- **GAP**: Should validate production readiness demos

**SPAWN_INTEGRATION_AGENT**
- Spawns agent to execute merges
- **GAP**: Should pass demo requirements to integration agent
- **GAP**: Should remind about R291 demo gates

**Integration Agent TESTING State**
- Runs build and tests
- **GAP**: Should explicitly run demo scripts
- **GAP**: Should capture demo output/evidence

### 3. Alignment Issues Identified

1. **Demo Planning Gap**: Merge plans don't specify when/how to run demos
2. **Demo Verification Gap**: Code review states don't check demo quality
3. **Demo Execution Gap**: Integration testing doesn't explicitly run demos
4. **Demo Orchestration Gap**: No clear demo sequencing for multi-effort integrations

## üéØ RECOMMENDATIONS

### Priority 1: Critical Updates (MUST DO)

#### 1. Update WAVE_MERGE_PLANNING to Include Demo Planning
Add to merge plan requirements:
```markdown
## Demo Execution Plan
- After each effort merge: Run effort-specific demo
- After all merges: Run integrated wave demo
- Capture all demo outputs in demo-results/
```

#### 2. Update Integration Agent TESTING State
Add explicit demo execution:
```bash
# Run individual effort demos
for demo in */demo-features.sh; do
    echo "Running: $demo"
    bash "$demo" || DEMO_STATUS="FAILED"
done

# Run integrated demo
./wave-demo.sh || WAVE_DEMO_STATUS="FAILED"
```

#### 3. Update INTEGRATION_CODE_REVIEW States
Add demo verification requirements:
- Check demo scripts exist and are executable
- Verify demo documentation completeness
- Validate demo coverage of features
- Ensure demo outputs are captured

### Priority 2: Important Enhancements

#### 4. Create Demo Orchestration Requirements
For multi-effort integrations:
- Define demo execution order
- Specify demo dependencies
- Create demo aggregation strategy

#### 5. Add Demo Quality Metrics
Track and report:
- Demo coverage percentage
- Demo execution time
- Demo failure points
- Demo documentation quality

### Priority 3: Nice-to-Have Improvements

#### 6. Demo Automation Enhancements
- Auto-generate demo scripts from effort plans
- Create demo validation framework
- Build demo regression suite

## üìù IMPLEMENTATION PLAN

### Phase 1: Update State Rules (IMMEDIATE)
1. Update WAVE_MERGE_PLANNING/rules.md
2. Update INTEGRATION_CODE_REVIEW/rules.md
3. Update integration agent TESTING/rules.md
4. Update SPAWN_INTEGRATION_AGENT/rules.md

### Phase 2: Update Templates (TODAY)
1. Add demo section to merge plan template
2. Add demo checklist to code review template
3. Add demo execution to integration test template

### Phase 3: Verify Compliance (TOMORROW)
1. Test updated flow with sample project
2. Verify all demo gates work
3. Update documentation

## ‚úÖ VALIDATION CHECKLIST

Before considering complete:
- [ ] All merge planning states require demo planning
- [ ] All code review states verify demo presence
- [ ] Integration testing explicitly runs demos
- [ ] Demo failures trigger ERROR_RECOVERY
- [ ] Demo artifacts count toward size limits
- [ ] Demo documentation is mandatory
- [ ] Demo execution order is specified
- [ ] Demo results are captured and verified

## üî¥ CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORS

1. **NO INTEGRATION WITHOUT DEMO**: Every integration must demonstrate working functionality
2. **DEMO PLANNING UPFRONT**: Demo requirements in every effort plan (R330)
3. **DEMO GATES ENFORCED**: Build/Test/Demo must ALL pass (R291)
4. **DEMO SIZE COUNTED**: Demo artifacts count toward 800-line limit
5. **DEMO FAILURES BLOCK**: Failed demos trigger ERROR_RECOVERY

## üìä IMPACT ASSESSMENT

### Current State Risk
- **MEDIUM**: Core demo rules exist but gaps in new states
- Missing explicit demo execution in some states
- Demo planning not fully integrated in merge planning

### After Updates Risk
- **LOW**: Comprehensive demo coverage across all states
- Explicit demo requirements at every level
- Clear demo execution and verification protocol

## üé¨ CONCLUSION

The new integration states have PARTIAL demo coverage:
- ‚úÖ MONITORING_INTEGRATION fully enforces demo gates
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Merge planning states need demo planning requirements
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Code review states need demo verification requirements
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Integration testing needs explicit demo execution

**RECOMMENDATION**: Implement Priority 1 updates immediately to ensure full demo compliance across all new integration states.
