## üéØ KEY ENFORCEMENT PATTERNS

### For Regular States:
```markdown
## üö® [STATE_NAME] IS A VERB - [ACTION] IMMEDIATELY! üö®

**THE MOMENT YOU ENTER THIS STATE, YOU MUST:**
1. [Specific immediate action]
2. [Another immediate action]
3. Check TodoWrite for pending items and process them

**FORBIDDEN - AUTOMATIC FAILURE:**
- ‚ùå "STATE TRANSITION COMPLETE: Now in [STATE]" [stops]
- ‚ùå "Successfully entered [STATE] state" [waits]
- ‚ùå "Ready to [action]" [pauses]

**REQUIRED - IMMEDIATE ACTION:**
- ‚úÖ "Entering [STATE], [doing specific action now]..."
- ‚úÖ "[Verb form], [starting task]..."
```

### For Waiting States:
- Emphasized ACTIVE polling, not passive waiting
- Required status checks every 5-10 seconds
- Must report what's being checked

### For Terminal States:
- SUCCESS and HARD_STOP marked as ONLY states where stopping allowed
- Must complete final actions then may terminate

## üö® VIOLATIONS TO WATCH FOR

### Common Anti-Patterns Now Forbidden:
1. **State Announcements**: "I'm now in MONITOR state"
2. **Preparation Statements**: "Ready to begin monitoring"
3. **Passive Waiting**: "Waiting for agents to complete"
4. **Transition Celebrations**: "Successfully transitioned to..."
5. **Action Delays**: "I will now start..."

### Required Patterns:
1. **Immediate Action**: "Entering MONITOR, checking E3.1.1 status NOW..."
2. **Active Work**: "MONITORING: E3.1.1 has 312 lines, checking E3.1.2..."
3. **Continuous Progress**: Never stop until terminal state

## üìä COMPLIANCE METRICS

### Rules Coverage:
- ‚úÖ 100% of orchestrator states updated
- ‚úÖ All state files include immediate action header
- ‚úÖ Terminal states properly marked
- ‚úÖ Waiting states specify active polling

### Documentation:
- ‚úÖ Master rule R233 created
- ‚úÖ Rule registry updated
- ‚úÖ State machine documentation updated
- ‚úÖ All 24 state rules files updated

## üéØ EXPECTED IMPACT

### Immediate Benefits:
1. **No More Stalling**: Orchestrators can't stop after state transitions
2. **Clear Expectations**: Every state demands immediate action
3. **Better Flow**: Work continues without announcements
4. **Accountability**: Violations are now automatic failures

### Grading Impact:
- Violation of R233 = AUTOMATIC FAILURE (-100%)
- Applies to ALL agents, ALL states
- No exceptions except terminal states

## üîç VALIDATION CHECKLIST

- [x] All 24 orchestrator states have updated rules
- [x] R233 created as SUPREME LAW
- [x] Rule registry includes R233
- [x] State machine documentation updated
- [x] Terminal states properly marked
- [x] Waiting states require active polling
- [x] No states allow passive waiting
- [x] Examples provided for compliance

## üìã RECOMMENDATIONS

### For Orchestrators:
1. Review R233 before starting ANY work
2. Never announce state transitions
3. Start working immediately upon state entry
4. Even in waiting states, actively poll

### For System Maintainers:
1. Monitor for R233 violations
2. Update agent prompts to reference R233
3. Include R233 in agent training
4. Track violation frequency

## ‚úÖ MISSION COMPLETE

All orchestrator states now enforce immediate action upon entry. The Software Factory will no longer tolerate agents that stop to announce their state transitions. States are commands to execute, not places to rest!
