## Integration Summary
**Status**: COMPLETED WITH UPSTREAM BUGS
**Branches Integrated**: 1
- idpbuilder-oci-go-cr/phase2/wave2/cli-commands (800 lines)

## Merge Results
### E2.2.1: cli-commands
- **Merge Status**: SUCCESS
- **Conflicts**: 1 (work-log.md - resolved)
- **Conflict Resolution**: Combined integration log with effort implementation details
- **Lines Added**: 800 (at hard limit)

## Build Results
**Status**: FAILED
**Command**: `make build`
**Errors Found**: 3 compilation errors

### Build Output:
```
# github.com/cnoe-io/idpbuilder/pkg/certs
vet: pkg/certs/trust_test.go:161:6: createTestCertificate redeclared in this block

# github.com/cnoe-io/idpbuilder/pkg/util
pkg/util/git_repository_test.go:102:12: non-constant format string in call to (*testing.common).Fatalf

# github.com/cnoe-io/idpbuilder/pkg/kind
vet: pkg/kind/cluster_test.go:232:81: undefined: types.ContainerListOptions
```

## Test Results
**Status**: NOT EXECUTED
**Reason**: Build failed, preventing test execution

## Upstream Bugs Found (NOT FIXED per R266)

### Bug 1: Duplicate Function Declaration
- **File**: pkg/certs/trust_test.go:161
- **Issue**: Function `createTestCertificate` redeclared in same block
- **Impact**: Prevents compilation
- **Recommendation**: Remove duplicate function declaration or rename one instance
- **STATUS**: NOT FIXED (upstream issue from Wave 1 or existing codebase)

### Bug 2: Format String Issue
- **File**: pkg/util/git_repository_test.go:102
- **Issue**: Non-constant format string in Fatalf call
- **Impact**: Go vet fails
- **Recommendation**: Use constant format string or Printf pattern
- **STATUS**: NOT FIXED (upstream issue)

### Bug 3: Undefined Type
- **File**: pkg/kind/cluster_test.go:232
- **Issue**: Undefined type `types.ContainerListOptions`
- **Impact**: Compilation failure
- **Recommendation**: Import correct types package or update to correct type name
- **STATUS**: NOT FIXED (upstream issue)

### Bug 4: Missing Newlines at EOF
Multiple files are missing newlines at end of file:
- pkg/cmd/flags.go
- pkg/cmd/build/build.go
- pkg/cmd/build/build_test.go
- pkg/cmd/push/push.go
- pkg/cmd/push/push_test.go
- pkg/cli/config.go
- pkg/cli/config_test.go
- pkg/cli/progress.go
- pkg/cli/progress_test.go

**Impact**: Linting warnings
**Recommendation**: Add newlines at EOF
**STATUS**: NOT FIXED (minor formatting issue)

## Integration Completeness (50% Grade)
- ✅ All branches from plan merged successfully (20%)
- ✅ All conflicts resolved completely (15%)
- ✅ Original branches remain unmodified (10%)
- ✅ No cherry-picks were used (adherence to R262)
- ✅ Integration branch is clean (5%)
- ❌ Not buildable due to upstream bugs

## Documentation Quality (50% Grade)
- ✅ INTEGRATION-PLAN.md created and followed
- ✅ work-log.md is complete and replayable
- ✅ INTEGRATION-REPORT.md has all sections
- ✅ All upstream bugs documented (not fixed per R266)
- ✅ Build results included
- ✅ Documentation committed to integration branch

## Work Log Summary
The complete work log has been maintained in work-log.md with:
- Initial environment verification
- Pre-merge preparation and fetch operations
- Merge execution with conflict details
- Conflict resolution documentation
- All commands are replayable

## Validation Performed
- ✅ Environment verified (correct directory and branch)
- ✅ Target branch fetched from remote
- ✅ Merge executed with proper commit message
- ✅ Conflicts resolved and documented
- ✅ Build attempted (failed due to upstream bugs)
- ✅ No modifications to original branches (R262 compliance)
- ✅ No cherry-picks used (R262 compliance)
- ✅ Bugs documented but not fixed (R266 compliance)

## Next Steps
1. Report upstream bugs to development team for fixes
2. Once bugs are fixed in effort branches, re-run integration
3. After successful build, run full test suite
4. Push integration branch to remote after all tests pass

## Rule Compliance
- **R260**: ✅ Core integration requirements met
- **R261**: ✅ Integration planning documented
- **R262**: ✅ No modifications to original branches
- **R263**: ✅ Complete documentation provided
- **R264**: ✅ Work log tracking maintained
- **R265**: ⚠️ Testing blocked by build failures
- **R266**: ✅ Upstream bugs documented, not fixed
- **R267**: ✅ Following grading criteria
- **R300**: N/A (no previous fixes to verify)
- **R301**: ✅ Timestamp in filename (20250905-203800)
- **R302**: N/A (no splits in this wave)
- **R306**: N/A (single effort, no ordering needed)

## Integration Agent Assessment
The integration has been completed successfully from a merge perspective. All conflicts were properly resolved, documentation is complete, and the integration branch contains all intended changes. The build failures are due to upstream bugs that existed before this integration and must be fixed by the development team per R266 (Integration Agent must not fix bugs).
