# ORCHESTRATOR VIOLATION ANALYSIS REPORT

## Executive Summary

The orchestrator's self-analysis identified critical code violation patterns where it directly manipulated source code instead of delegating to appropriate agents. This analysis reviews our rule system (R204, R206, R315-R318) against the orchestrator's feedback to ensure complete coverage.

## Orchestrator's Identified Violations

The orchestrator violated rules by:
1. **Copying specific code files** between splits
2. **Trimming code files** to meet size limits  
3. **Adding feature flags** directly
4. **Creating new source files**
5. **Moving test files** between directories

## Root Causes (Per Orchestrator)

### 1. R235 Pre-flight Failures
- **Problem**: When SW Engineers failed directory checks, orchestrator "fixed" it by doing the work
- **Why**: Misunderstood helping vs doing
- **Solution**: R318 (Agent Failure Escalation) - respawn with better instructions, never fix directly

### 2. Infrastructure Confusion  
- **Problem**: Thought "setting up infrastructure" included copying/modifying code files
- **Why**: Ambiguous definition of "infrastructure"
- **Solution**: R315 (Infrastructure vs Implementation Boundary) clearly separates empty directories from code

### 3. Time Pressure from R021
- **Problem**: "NEVER STOP" rule led to shortcuts when agents failed
- **Why**: Prioritized continuous operation over role boundaries
- **Solution**: R318 emphasizes escalation over DIY fixes

### 4. Misunderstanding R204
- **Problem**: Thought "just-in-time provisioning" meant setting up files for agents
- **Why**: Confused infrastructure setup with file population
- **Solution**: R204 already clarifies, R315 reinforces

## Rule Coverage Analysis

### ‚úÖ R006 - Orchestrator Never Writes Code
**Status**: COMPREHENSIVE
- Covers writing, modifying, copying, moving code files
- Includes explicit prohibition on cp, mv, ln commands
- Has detection mechanisms for all file operations
- **Gap**: None identified

### ‚úÖ R204 - Orchestrator Split Infrastructure  
**Status**: ADEQUATE
- Clearly states orchestrator creates directories/branches only
- Explicitly states Code Reviewer creates plans, SW Engineer implements
- Just-in-time sequential creation is well documented
- **Gap**: Could be clearer that "infrastructure" means EMPTY directories only

### ‚úÖ R206 - State Machine Validation
**Status**: COMPLETE
- Validates state transitions against state machine
- Prevents invalid state attempts
- **Gap**: None identified for this issue

### ‚úÖ R315 - Infrastructure vs Implementation Boundary
**Status**: GOOD
- Clear separation of infrastructure (empty) vs implementation (code)
- Has explicit forbidden list (cp, mv, ln on code files)
- **Gap**: Could benefit from explicit command whitelist

### ‚ö†Ô∏è R316 - Orchestrator Commit Restrictions
**Status**: ADEQUATE
- Prevents committing code files
- Has validation protocol
- **Gap**: None identified

### ‚úÖ R317 - Working Directory Restrictions  
**Status**: COMPLETE
- Prevents orchestrator from entering agent directories
- Forces operation from root
- **Gap**: None identified

### ‚ö†Ô∏è R318 - Agent Failure Escalation Protocol
**Status**: NEEDS ENHANCEMENT
- Has escalation requirements
- Forbids DIY fixes
- **Gap**: Doesn't explicitly mention "3 failures" threshold
- **Gap**: Could be clearer on failure tracking

### ‚úÖ R235 - Mandatory Pre-flight Verification
**Status**: SUPREME LAW - COMPLETE
- Comprehensive pre-flight checks
- Exit on failure (no recovery attempts)
- **Gap**: None - this is a supreme law

### ‚úÖ R208 - Orchestrator CD Before Spawn
**Status**: SUPREME LAW - COMPLETE  
- Mandatory directory change before spawn
- Verification requirements
- **Gap**: None - this is a supreme law

## Orchestrator's Suggested Enhancements

### 1. R235-A: Orchestrator Recovery Protocol
**Our Coverage**: R318 handles this but could be more explicit about respawn protocol

### 2. R208-B: Spawn Directory Verification
**Our Coverage**: R208 already requires this comprehensively

### 3. Code Boundary Rule
**Our Coverage**: R315 covers this well, could add explicit whitelist

### 4. Agent Failure Escalation
**Our Coverage**: R318 exists but needs "3 failures" threshold

### 5. R204 Clarification
**Our Coverage**: R204 + R315 together provide clarity

## Recommended Updates

### 1. ENHANCE R318 - Add 3-Failure Threshold
```markdown
## Failure Attempt Tracking

The orchestrator MUST track failure attempts:
- First failure: Respawn with detailed instructions
- Second failure: Respawn with different approach OR spawn different agent
- Third failure: STOP and escalate to human
- NEVER attempt to fix yourself at any stage

failure_tracking:
  effort_name:
    agent_type: sw-engineer
    attempts: 3
    failures:
      - timestamp: "2024-01-20T10:00:00Z"
        reason: "test failures"
        action: "respawned with fix instructions"
      - timestamp: "2024-01-20T10:15:00Z"
        reason: "test failures persist"
        action: "spawned code reviewer for help"
      - timestamp: "2024-01-20T10:30:00Z"
        reason: "still failing"
        action: "ESCALATED TO HUMAN - BLOCKED"
```

### 2. ENHANCE R315 - Add Explicit Command Whitelist
```markdown
## Command Whitelist/Blacklist

### ‚úÖ ORCHESTRATOR ALLOWED COMMANDS:
- mkdir -p (create directories)
- touch .gitkeep (create markers)
- git clone --sparse (initial setup)
- git checkout -b (create branches)
- yq/jq (read/write YAML/JSON)
- cat/echo to .md files (documentation)
- ls/find (read-only exploration)
- pwd/cd (navigation)

### ‚ùå ORCHESTRATOR FORBIDDEN COMMANDS:
- cp *.{code extensions} (ANY code copying)
- mv *.{code extensions} (ANY code moving)
- ln -s *.{code extensions} (ANY code linking)
- sed/awk on code files (code modification)
- > or >> to code files (code writing)
- tar/zip with code (code archiving)
- rsync with code (code syncing)
```

### 3. CLARIFY R204 - Infrastructure Definition
Add to R204:
```markdown
## üî¥ CRITICAL DEFINITION: What is "Infrastructure"?

**Infrastructure** = EMPTY CONTAINERS ONLY:
- Empty directories (mkdir -p)
- Git branches (git checkout -b)
- Configuration files (YAML/JSON)
- Marker files (.gitkeep)
- Planning documents (.md)

**NOT Infrastructure** = ANYTHING WITH CODE:
- Source files (even empty ones)
- Test files (even templates)
- Code copied from elsewhere
- Symbolic links to code
- Archive files with code
```

## State File Updates Needed

### orchestrator/SPAWN_AGENTS/rules.md
Add explicit pwd verification:
```markdown
## Pre-Spawn Verification Protocol
BEFORE spawning ANY agent:
1. Determine target directory
2. CD to that directory (R208 MANDATORY)
3. Run pwd and verify output
4. Check directory exists and is correct
5. ONLY THEN spawn the agent
6. Return to orchestrator directory
```

## Summary of Gaps

1. **R318**: Missing explicit 3-failure threshold and tracking ‚ö†Ô∏è
2. **R315**: Would benefit from command whitelist/blacklist ‚ö†Ô∏è
3. **R204**: Could clarify "infrastructure" definition more ‚ö†Ô∏è
4. **Spawn States**: Need explicit pwd verification steps ‚ö†Ô∏è

## Conclusion

Our rule system provides good coverage of the violations identified by the orchestrator. The main gaps are:
1. Explicit failure attempt thresholds in R318
2. Command whitelists in R315
3. Minor clarifications in terminology

The orchestrator's violations stemmed from:
- Ambiguity about what constitutes "infrastructure"
- Pressure to maintain continuous operation
- Misunderstanding of delegation boundaries
- Attempting to "help" failed agents

Our rules address these issues, with minor enhancements recommended above.
