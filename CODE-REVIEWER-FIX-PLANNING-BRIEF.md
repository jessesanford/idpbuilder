# Brief for Code Reviewer Fix Planning

From: orchestrator/ANALYZE_BUILD_FAILURES

## Your Task
Create a detailed fix plan for the build failure identified in pkg/certs/chain_validator_test.go.

## Input Documents
1. BUILD-ERROR-ANALYSIS.md - Categorized error showing syntax issue at line 173
2. ERROR-TO-EFFORT-MAP.md - Error location mapping
3. BUILD-ERRORS.txt - Raw error output showing: `pkg/certs/chain_validator_test.go:173:1: expected declaration, found '}'`

## Required Outputs
Create FIX-PLAN-certs-syntax.md that includes:
1. Exact code changes needed
   - File: pkg/certs/chain_validator_test.go
   - Line: 173
   - Action: Remove the extra closing brace
2. Before/after code snippets showing the fix
3. Verification steps:
   - Run `go fmt ./...` to ensure formatting passes
   - Run `make build` to verify build succeeds
4. Test requirements:
   - Ensure the test file still compiles
   - Run the specific test to verify functionality

## Priority Order
1. This is the ONLY error blocking the build
2. Fix immediately to unblock all other work

## Success Criteria
- The syntax error is resolved
- go fmt completes successfully
- make build completes without errors
- The test file maintains its intended functionality

## Important Context
- This appears to be a merge conflict resolution issue or copy-paste error
- The fix is straightforward but needs careful verification
- Must ensure no other syntax issues are introduced
- Consider checking for similar issues in nearby code

## Backport Requirements (R321)
Since we're in the integration-testing branch, this fix must be:
1. Applied to the integration-testing branch first
2. Immediately backported to the source branch where certs was developed
3. Verified in both locations
