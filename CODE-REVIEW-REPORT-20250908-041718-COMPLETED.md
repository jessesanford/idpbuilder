- **Current Lines**: 615 lines (verified by manual count of actual implementation files)
- **Limit**: 800 lines
- **Status**: COMPLIANT (77% of limit)
- **Tool Issues**: line-counter.sh had difficulty detecting base branch; used git diff as fallback

### Files Implemented:
- pkg/build/types.go (37 lines)
- pkg/build/image_builder.go (176 lines)
- pkg/build/context.go (115 lines)
- pkg/build/storage.go (73 lines)
- pkg/build/feature_flags.go (14 lines)
- pkg/build/image_builder_test.go (127 lines)
- pkg/build/context_test.go (80 lines)

## üî¥ CRITICAL BLOCKER: R320 Violation - Stub Implementations Found

### **IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED**
The implementation contains stub methods that violate R320 (Zero Tolerance for Stubs):

1. **ListImages()** - Returns nil with comment "not implemented in this effort per R311"
2. **RemoveImage()** - Returns error "not implemented: RemoveImage will be implemented in future effort"
3. **TagImage()** - Returns error "not implemented: TagImage will be implemented in future effort"

**R320 MANDATE**: ANY stub implementation = CRITICAL BLOCKER = FAILED REVIEW
- These methods MUST be either:
  - Fully implemented with working functionality
  - Removed entirely from the interface/struct

## Functionality Review
- ‚úÖ Core image building functionality implemented correctly
- ‚úÖ Proper use of go-containerregistry library
- ‚úÖ Context directory tarring with exclusions
- ‚úÖ Local storage management
- ‚úÖ Feature flag implementation
- ‚ùå Stub methods present (R320 violation)
- ‚úÖ Error handling appropriate
- ‚úÖ Edge cases handled

## Code Quality
- ‚úÖ Clean, readable code structure
- ‚úÖ Proper variable naming conventions
- ‚úÖ Appropriate comments and documentation
- ‚úÖ No obvious code smells (except stubs)
- ‚úÖ Good separation of concerns
- ‚úÖ Proper error wrapping with context

## Test Coverage
- **Unit Tests**: 47.9% (Required: 80%)
- **Test Quality**: Good for implemented features
- ‚ùå Coverage below required threshold
- ‚úÖ Tests passing successfully
- ‚úÖ Tests cover happy paths and error cases
- ‚ùå Missing tests for tar creation edge cases
- ‚ùå Missing tests for storage edge cases

### Test Execution Results:
```
=== RUN   TestNewBuilder              --- PASS
=== RUN   TestBuildImageFeatureDisabled --- PASS
=== RUN   TestBuildImageSuccess        --- PASS
=== RUN   TestBuildImageInvalidOptions --- PASS
=== RUN   TestGetStoragePathAndStubs   --- PASS
=== RUN   TestCreateTarFromContext     --- PASS
=== RUN   TestShouldExclude           --- PASS
```

## Pattern Compliance
- ‚úÖ Go best practices followed
- ‚úÖ Error handling patterns correct
- ‚úÖ Interface design appropriate (except stubs)
- ‚úÖ Package structure clean

## Security Review
- ‚úÖ No obvious security vulnerabilities
- ‚úÖ Proper file permission handling (0755 for dirs, 0644 for files)
- ‚úÖ Input validation present
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Consider validating tar archive size limits to prevent DoS

## Build and Integration
- ‚úÖ Package builds successfully (`go build ./pkg/build`)
- ‚úÖ No Phase 1 dependency issues
- ‚úÖ Clean separation from other efforts
- ‚úÖ Proper workspace isolation maintained
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Main project build has pre-existing issues (not from this effort)

## Independent Branch Mergeability (R307)
- ‚úÖ Branch properly based on Phase 1 integration
- ‚úÖ No contamination from other efforts
- ‚úÖ Would compile when merged alone to main
- ‚ùå Stub implementations prevent full functionality

## Issues Found

### CRITICAL (Must Fix):
1. **R320 Violation - Stub Implementations**:
   - File: `pkg/build/image_builder.go` lines 160-176
   - Remove or implement: ListImages(), RemoveImage(), TagImage()
   - These CANNOT remain as stubs per R320

### MAJOR (Should Fix):
2. **Low Test Coverage**:
   - Current: 47.9%
   - Required: 80%
   - Add tests for:
     - Tar creation with various exclusion patterns
     - Storage error conditions
     - Label handling edge cases
     - Context validation scenarios

### MINOR (Consider):
3. **Security Enhancement**:
   - Add tar archive size limits
   - Consider rate limiting for build operations
   - Add context timeout handling

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions Required:
1. **Remove ALL stub implementations** to comply with R320:
   ```go
   // REMOVE these methods entirely from image_builder.go:
   // - ListImages() 
   // - RemoveImage()
   // - TagImage()
   ```

2. **Increase test coverage** to meet 80% requirement:
   - Add tests for error paths in createTarFromContext
   - Add tests for storage edge cases
   - Add tests for concurrent build operations

### Enhancement Suggestions:
1. Consider implementing build caching for repeated contexts
2. Add metrics/logging for build operations
3. Consider supporting multi-platform images in future

## Next Steps
**NEEDS_FIXES**: The following must be addressed before approval:

1. **CRITICAL**: Remove ALL stub implementations (R320 compliance)
2. **MAJOR**: Increase test coverage to 80% minimum
3. **MINOR**: Address security considerations

Once these issues are fixed, particularly the R320 violation, the implementation will be ready for integration.

## Compliance Summary
- ‚úÖ Size Limit: COMPLIANT (615/800 lines)
- ‚ùå R320 (No Stubs): VIOLATED - Critical blocker
- ‚ùå Test Coverage: BELOW THRESHOLD (47.9% vs 80% required)
- ‚úÖ R307 (Independent Mergeability): PARTIAL (blocked by stubs)
- ‚úÖ Build Status: SUCCESS (package level)
- ‚úÖ Phase 1 Integration: CLEAN
