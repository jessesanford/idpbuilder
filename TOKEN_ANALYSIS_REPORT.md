## Analysis by Agent

### Orchestrator (251,233 tokens - 70% of total)
- **79 states** - Most complex agent with extensive state machine
- **Top 5 Heavy States:**
  1. PHASE_INTEGRATION: 11,549 tokens
  2. SETUP_EFFORT_INFRASTRUCTURE: 9,341 tokens
  3. CREATE_NEXT_SPLIT_INFRASTRUCTURE: 8,107 tokens
  4. WAVE_COMPLETE: 7,700 tokens
  5. INTEGRATION: 7,122 tokens
- **Optimization Potential:** High - Many states over 5,000 tokens

### SW Engineer (41,278 tokens - 11.5% of total)
- **9 states** - Focused agent with heavy implementation states
- **Top 3 Heavy States:**
  1. TEST_WRITING: 9,967 tokens (24.1% of agent)
  2. IMPLEMENTATION: 8,961 tokens (21.7% of agent)
  3. FIX_ISSUES: 8,513 tokens (20.6% of agent)
- **Optimization Potential:** Very High - 3 states consume 66% of tokens

### Code Reviewer (44,869 tokens - 12.5% of total)
- **15 states** - Review and validation focused
- **Top 3 Heavy States:**
  1. CODE_REVIEW: 9,165 tokens (20.4% of agent)
  2. VALIDATION: 6,486 tokens (14.5% of agent)
  3. CREATE_SPLIT_PLAN: 6,468 tokens (14.4% of agent)
- **Optimization Potential:** High - Top 3 states consume 49% of tokens

### Architect (16,524 tokens - 4.6% of total)
- **10 states** - Lightweight planning agent
- **Relatively balanced** - No extreme outliers
- **Optimization Potential:** Low - Already optimized

### Integration (5,124 tokens - 1.4% of total)
- **5 states** - Minimal state machine
- **Very lightweight** - Average 1,025 tokens per state
- **Optimization Potential:** None needed

## Recommendations for Optimization

### Priority 1: Heavy SW Engineer States
- **TEST_WRITING** (9,967 tokens) - Consider extracting common patterns
- **IMPLEMENTATION** (8,961 tokens) - Could be split into sub-states
- **FIX_ISSUES** (8,513 tokens) - May have redundant instructions

### Priority 2: Orchestrator Integration States
- **PHASE_INTEGRATION** (11,549 tokens) - Largest single state
- **SETUP_EFFORT_INFRASTRUCTURE** (9,341 tokens) - Could be modularized
- **CREATE_NEXT_SPLIT_INFRASTRUCTURE** (8,107 tokens) - Potential for reuse

### Priority 3: Code Reviewer States
- **CODE_REVIEW** (9,165 tokens) - Could reference shared patterns
- **VALIDATION** (6,486 tokens) - May have duplicate checks
- **CREATE_SPLIT_PLAN** (6,468 tokens) - Could use templates

## Token Distribution Insights

### State Count by Size
- **> 8,000 tokens:** 6 states (5%)
- **5,000 - 8,000 tokens:** 14 states (12%)
- **3,000 - 5,000 tokens:** 27 states (23%)
- **1,000 - 3,000 tokens:** 18 states (15%)
- **< 1,000 tokens:** 53 states (45%)

### Concentration Analysis
- **Top 10 states:** 82,645 tokens (23% of total)
- **Top 20 states:** 128,114 tokens (36% of total)
- **Orchestrator alone:** 251,233 tokens (70% of total)

## Conclusions

1. **Orchestrator Dominance:** The orchestrator agent contains 70% of all state rule tokens, suggesting it may be doing too much or could benefit from modularization.

2. **Heavy State Concentration:** The top 20 states (17% of all states) contain 36% of all tokens, indicating significant optimization potential.

3. **SW Engineer Imbalance:** Three states consume 66% of the SW Engineer's tokens, suggesting these states might be handling too many responsibilities.

4. **Integration Efficiency:** The Integration agent is extremely lightweight and efficient, serving as a good model for optimization.

5. **Potential Savings:** Optimizing just the top 10 heaviest states could reduce total token count by 10-15% without losing functionality.
