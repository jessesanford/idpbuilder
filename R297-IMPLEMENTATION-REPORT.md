# R297 Implementation Report - Architect Split Detection Protocol

## Executive Summary

**CRITICAL ISSUE RESOLVED**: The architect was incorrectly demanding re-splits of already-split efforts because it was measuring the INTEGRATED branch size instead of the ORIGINAL effort branches.

## The Problem

From the user's transcript:
- E1.1.2 was properly split into 2 parts during implementation (commits 449a150, 0abb4a5)
- The splits were merged together for integration testing (as they should be)
- The architect measured the INTEGRATED result (904 lines) and demanded another split
- The architect ignored that `split_count: 2` was already in the state file
- The architect should have checked the ORIGINAL effort branches, not the integration branch

## Root Cause

The architect was measuring the wrong thing:
- **WRONG**: Measuring integration workspace where all splits are merged together
- **RIGHT**: Measuring original effort directories/branches where the actual PRs will come from

## Solution Implemented: R297 - Architect Split Detection Protocol

### Rule Summary
R297 mandates that architects MUST:
1. Check `split_count` in orchestrator-state.json BEFORE measuring any effort
2. If `split_count > 0`, the effort was already split and is COMPLIANT
3. Measure ORIGINAL effort branches in `/efforts/phase*/wave*/[effort-name]/`
4. NOT measure the integrated branch size for compliance
5. Understand that integration branches are ONLY for testing merge compatibility

### Key Clarifications
- **Integration branches**: Merge all splits together (WILL exceed limits - expected!)
- **PRs come from**: Original effort branches (each must be under limit)
- **Already-split efforts**: Are compliant even if integration exceeds limit
- **Integration size**: Is irrelevant for PR size compliance

## Files Updated

### 1. Rule Library
- **Created**: `rule-library/R297-architect-split-detection-protocol.md`
  - Complete protocol with code examples
  - Clear DO/DON'T sections
  - Integration branch clarification

### 2. Rule Registry
- **Updated**: `rule-library/RULE-REGISTRY.md`
  - Added R297 to the registry as BLOCKING rule

### 3. Architect Configuration
- **Already Updated**: `.claude/agents/architect.md`
  - R297 prominently referenced
  - Clear instructions for size measurement

### 4. Architect State Rules
- **Updated**: `agent-states/architect/WAVE_REVIEW/rules.md`
  - R297 added as first assessment step
  - Clear workflow for checking splits
- **Updated**: `agent-states/architect/PHASE_ASSESSMENT/rules.md`
  - R297 added for phase-level assessments
- **Updated**: `agent-states/architect/INTEGRATION_REVIEW/rules.md`
  - R297 added for integration reviews

### 5. Related Rules
- **R022** (Architect Size Verification): Already references R297
- **R076** (Effort Size Compliance): References R297 in WAVE_REVIEW state

### 6. Verification Tools
- **Created**: `utilities/verify-r297-implementation.sh`
  - Automated verification of R297 implementation
  - Checks all required files and patterns
  - Ensures consistent implementation

## Verification Results

```
✅ R297 FULLY IMPLEMENTED - All checks passed!

The architect will now:
1. Check split_count BEFORE measuring any effort
2. Measure ORIGINAL effort branches (not integration)
3. Recognize already-split efforts as compliant
4. Understand integration branches exceed limits by design
```

## Impact

### Before R297
- Architects demanded unnecessary re-splits
- Already-compliant efforts were blocked
- Progress was halted on split efforts
- Integration branch sizes were misunderstood

### After R297
- Architects check split_count first
- Already-split efforts are recognized as compliant
- Correct branches are measured for compliance
- Integration branch behavior is understood

## Example Workflow

```bash
# Architect reviews E1.1.2
SPLIT_COUNT=$(yq '.efforts_completed."E1.1.2".split_count' orchestrator-state.json)
# Result: 2

if [ "$SPLIT_COUNT" -gt 0 ]; then
    echo "✅ E1.1.2 already split into $SPLIT_COUNT parts - COMPLIANT"
    # No size measurement needed
fi

# Integration shows 904 lines but that's EXPECTED
# PRs will come from the two 450-line effort branches
```

## Grading Impact Prevention

R297 prevents these grading penalties:
- **-50%**: For demanding re-split of already-split efforts
- **-30%**: For measuring wrong branches
- **-40%**: For blocking compliant efforts

## Conclusion

R297 is now fully implemented across the Software Factory system. The architect will no longer incorrectly demand re-splits of already-split efforts. The critical distinction between integration branches (for testing) and effort branches (for PRs) is now clear and enforced.
