🚨🚨🚨 CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE ISSUE - R509 VIOLATION 🚨🚨🚨

Issue Detected: 2025-09-30 01:17:58Z
Agent: sw-engineer (Split-002)
State: SPLIT_IMPLEMENTATION

PROBLEM:
========
1. Split-001 has ALREADY implemented ALL files that Split-002 is supposed to implement:
   - Split-001 has: discovery.go, pusher.go, operations.go, logging.go, progress.go
   - Split-002 plan: implement discovery.go and pusher.go
   - CONFLICT: These files already exist in Split-001!

2. R509 CASCADE VIOLATION:
   - Expected base branch: phase1/wave2/E1.2.3-image-push-operations-split-001
   - Actual base branch: origin/main
   - Split-002 does NOT have Split-001's commits
   - This violates progressive trunk-based development (R501/R509)

ROOT CAUSE:
===========
The R359 fix for Split-001 restored ALL 1,631 lines to avoid deleting code.
This means Split-001 contains work intended for Split-001 + Split-002 + Split-003.

The split plans are now INVALID because:
- Split-001: Should have ~550 lines → Actually has 1,631 lines
- Split-002: Should add ~550 lines → Has nothing to add (already done)
- Split-003: Should add ~600 lines → May also have nothing to add

REQUIRED ACTION:
================
Per R509 (Mandatory Base Branch Validation):
❌ SW Engineer MUST NOT attempt to fix cascade issues
✅ STOP IMMEDIATELY and report to orchestrator
✅ Orchestrator must rebuild infrastructure OR revise split plans

RECOMMENDED SOLUTION:
=====================
Option 1: Cancel Split-002 and Split-003 (work already complete in Split-001)
Option 2: Rebase Split-002 on Split-001 and create NEW functionality
Option 3: Re-split the 1,631 lines properly across 3 splits

SW ENGINEER ACTION:
===================
✅ STOPPED work immediately (R509 compliance)
✅ Created this marker for orchestrator
❌ DID NOT attempt to fix git branches
❌ DID NOT implement duplicate code
❌ DID NOT continue with invalid split plan

Agent terminating per R509.
Awaiting orchestrator instructions.
