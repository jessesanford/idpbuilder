# Software Factory Template Creation Summary

## What Was Created

This template provides a complete, reusable software factory system that orchestrates AI agents through a formal state machine to manage large-scale software development projects.

## Key Components

### 1. Core System (`/core/`)
- **SOFTWARE-FACTORY-STATE-MACHINE.md**: The heart of the system defining all states and transitions
- **ORCHESTRATOR-MASTER-OPERATIONS-GUIDE.md**: Complete operational blueprint

### 2. Agent System (`/.claude/`)
- **CLAUDE.md**: Global rules, recovery procedures, TODO management
- **agents/**: Configurations for orchestrator, architect, code reviewer, SW engineer
- **commands/**: The `/continue-orchestrating` command definition

### 3. Critical Protocols (`/protocols/`)
Essential files for system operation:
- **IMPERATIVE-LINE-COUNT-RULE.md**: 800-line hard limit enforcement
- **EFFORT-SPLIT-CONTINUOUS-EXECUTION-PROTOCOL.md**: Sequential split handling
- **TODO-STATE-MANAGEMENT-PROTOCOL.md**: State transition persistence
- Plus 7 other critical protocols for planning, review, and testing

### 4. Optional Enhancements (`/possibly-needed-but-not-sure/`)
14 files that can be activated based on project complexity:
- Quick reference guides for faster operations
- Advanced architect protocols for strict compliance
- Comprehensive review guides for consistency
- Real-world examples for learning

### 5. Tools (`/tools/`)
- **line-counter.sh**: Configurable line counting tool for any language

### 6. Setup and Documentation
- **setup.sh**: Interactive setup script for new projects
- **README.md**: Comprehensive guide with file inventory
- **WHEN-TO-USE-THESE-FILES.md**: Decision guide for optional files
- Templates for project plans and state files

## Critical Discoveries During Creation

### Missing Critical Files
The initial template was missing several files referenced in CLAUDE.md:
1. **IMPERATIVE-LINE-COUNT-RULE.md** - Referenced 6 times, absolutely critical
2. **TODO-STATE-MANAGEMENT-PROTOCOL.md** - Initially misplaced in optional files
3. Several planning and review protocols essential for operation

### Key Design Decisions

1. **Separation of Critical vs Optional**
   - Core files required for basic operation
   - Optional files for enhanced workflows
   - Clear activation guidelines

2. **Language Agnostic**
   - Replaced KCP/Go specifics with placeholders
   - Configurable line counter for any language
   - Adaptable agent configurations

3. **Progressive Complexity**
   - Simple projects use core only
   - Medium projects add quick references
   - Complex projects activate everything

4. **State Persistence**
   - TODO files for state transitions
   - Compaction recovery in CLAUDE.md
   - Multiple recovery mechanisms

## How to Use This Template

### Quick Start
```bash
# Run the setup script
./setup.sh

# Answer prompts for:
# - Project name
# - Target directory  
# - Primary language
# - Complexity level

# Then in Claude Code:
/continue-orchestrating
```

### Manual Setup
1. Copy template to your project
2. Update paths in all `.md` files
3. Configure `line-counter.sh` for your language
4. Create your PROJECT-IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN.md
5. Initialize orchestrator-state.yaml
6. Run `/continue-orchestrating`

## System Guarantees

### Quality Gates
- ✅ Every effort ≤800 lines (enforced by IMPERATIVE-LINE-COUNT-RULE.md)
- ✅ 100% code review coverage (enforced by state machine)
- ✅ Architecture review at wave boundaries
- ✅ Test coverage requirements
- ✅ Sequential split execution

### State Management
- Formal state machine with defined transitions
- TODO persistence across context switches
- Recovery from compaction events
- Progress tracking through state file

### Agent Coordination
- Orchestrator never writes code (only coordinates)
- Each agent has specific responsibilities
- Clear handoffs between agents
- Startup verification protocols

## Template Validation

The template has been validated to ensure:
- All file references in CLAUDE.md resolve ✅
- All state transitions have protocols ✅
- All agents have startup requirements ✅
- Recovery mechanisms are in place ✅
- Size enforcement is multiply reinforced ✅

## For Different Project Types

### Web Applications
- Use TypeScript/JavaScript configuration
- Activate frontend/backend split protocols
- Focus on component isolation

### Microservices
- Use Go or Java configuration
- Activate all architect protocols
- Emphasize service boundaries

### Data Pipelines
- Use Python configuration
- Focus on validation protocols
- Activate testing requirements

### Enterprise Systems
- Activate all optional files
- Use strict architect reviews
- Maximum quality gates

## Support and Evolution

This template represents a complete, working system for AI-orchestrated development. It can be customized and extended based on specific project needs while maintaining the core state machine and quality gates that ensure successful delivery.

The system has been designed to:
- Scale from simple to complex projects
- Adapt to any programming language
- Maintain quality through enforced gates
- Recover from context loss gracefully
- Provide clear progress visibility

Start simple, measure everything, and activate additional protocols as needed. The core system is robust enough for immediate use, with optional enhancements available when complexity demands them.
