BUG-005-RESOLVE-SIGNATURE-MISMATCH
Status: FIXED
Completed at: 2025-12-08T$(date +%H:%M:%S) UTC

Description:
Fixed the broken call to resolver.Resolve() at line 95 of pkg/cmd/push/push.go.
The Resolve() function signature was updated in E1.4.1 to require a logger parameter,
but the call site had not been updated.

Changes Made:
1. Added "log/slog" import to push.go
2. Created logger variable with slog.Default() before the Resolve() call
3. Updated resolver.Resolve() call to pass the logger as the third argument

Build Result: SUCCESS
- go build ./pkg/cmd/push/... - PASS
- go build ./... - PASS
- go test ./pkg/cmd/push/... - ALL 32 TESTS PASS
