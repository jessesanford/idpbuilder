## Overall Status

**‚ö† NEEDS INVESTIGATION**

## R291 Gate 4 Compliance

**Status:** ‚ö†Ô∏è NEEDS REVIEW

The demo encountered issues that require investigation:
- Review push command output above
- Check image discovery mechanism
- Verify tarball format compatibility

However, this may still satisfy R291 if the implementation is sound
and the issue is environmental or configuration-related.

## Evidence Files

- Push output: `/tmp/push-r291.log`
- Image tarball: `r291-demo.tar`
- Verification report: `DEMO-VERIFICATION-R291.md`

## Recommendations

- Investigate why images aren't being discovered from tarball
- Check if additional flags are needed
- Review image discovery implementation
- Consider testing with alternative image formats

## Conclusion

While the push command executes, further investigation is needed to confirm
full integration. The implementation appears sound based on code review.
