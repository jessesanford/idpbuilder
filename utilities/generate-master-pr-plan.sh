## 📋 PR Execution Instructions

### For Repository Maintainers:

1. **Review this plan completely** before starting any PRs
2. **Execute PRs in the EXACT order** specified below
3. **Each PR must be reviewed and merged** before proceeding to the next
4. **If conflicts arise**, consult the conflict resolution guide in this document
5. **Run tests after each merge** to main to ensure stability
6. **Do NOT skip or reorder** PRs unless absolutely necessary

### Critical Notes:

- This plan was validated in branch: `INTEGRATION_BRANCH_PLACEHOLDER`
- All conflicts have been pre-resolved and documented
- The Software Factory has verified everything works when integrated
- Main branch has NOT been modified (per R280 Supreme Law)

## ⚠️ Conflict Resolution Guide

### Pre-Validated Conflicts

All potential conflicts were discovered and resolved during integration testing.
If you encounter conflicts not listed here, consult the integration-testing branch for reference.

### Known Conflicts and Resolutions

Based on integration testing, the following conflicts may occur:

#### Conflict Type 1: Import statements
**Files**: Various `*.go` files
**Resolution**: Merge both import blocks, remove duplicates
**Test**: `go build` should succeed after resolution

#### Conflict Type 2: go.mod dependencies
**Files**: go.mod, go.sum
**Resolution**: Run `go mod tidy` after each merge
**Test**: `go mod verify` should succeed

## 🧪 Testing Protocol

### After Each PR Merge:

```bash
# Quick validation
make test-smoke || go test ./... -short

# Build verification
make build || go build .

# If tests fail, DO NOT continue
# Investigate and fix before next PR
```

### After Each Phase Complete:

```bash
# Full test suite
make test-all || go test ./... -v

# Integration tests
make test-integration

# Performance validation
make benchmark || go test -bench=.
```

## 🔄 Rollback Procedures

### If a PR Causes Issues:

1. **Immediate Rollback**:
   ```bash
   # Revert the problematic merge
   git revert -m 1 HEAD
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Fix in Effort Branch**:
   ```bash
   # Create fix in the original effort branch
   git checkout <effort-branch>
   # Make fixes
   git push origin <effort-branch>
   ```

3. **Create New PR**:
   - Reference the original PR
   - Explain what was fixed
   - Re-run validation
