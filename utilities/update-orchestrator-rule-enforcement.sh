## 🔴🔴🔴 STOP! STATE RULE READING IS ABSOLUTELY FIRST! 🔴🔴🔴

**YOU HAVE ENTERED ${state_name} STATE - YOU MUST READ AND ACKNOWLEDGE ALL STATE RULES BEFORE DOING ANY STATE WORK!**

### ❌ DO NOT DO ANY ${state_name} WORK UNTIL RULES ARE READ:
${formatted_actions}- ❌ Update state files
- ❌ Continue to next state
- ❌ Think about what to do in this state

### ✅ YOU MUST IMMEDIATELY:
1. **READ** every rule file listed in PRIMARY DIRECTIVES below
2. **ACKNOWLEDGE** each rule individually with number and description
3. **ONLY THEN** proceed with ${state_name} work

### 🚨 FAILURE TO READ STATE RULES FIRST = IMMEDIATE EXIT 🚨
**If you do ANY ${state_name} work before reading and acknowledging rules:**
- **STOP ALL WORK IMMEDIATELY**
- **EXIT WITH FAILURE STATUS**
- **YOU HAVE VIOLATED STATE COMPLIANCE**

**THE SYSTEM IS MONITORING YOUR READ TOOL CALLS!**
