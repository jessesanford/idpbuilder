### üî¥üî¥üî¥ MANDATORY VALIDATION REQUIREMENT üî¥üî¥üî¥

**Per R288 and R324**: ALL state file updates MUST be validated before commit:

```bash
# After ANY update to orchestrator-state.json:
"$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/tools/validate-state.sh" orchestrator-state.json || {
    echo "‚ùå State file validation failed!"
    exit 288
}
```

**Use helper functions for automatic validation:**
```bash
# Source the helper functions
source "$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/utilities/state-file-update-functions.sh"

# Use safe functions that include validation:
safe_state_transition "NEW_STATE" "reason"
safe_update_field "field_name" "value"
```
EOF
    
    # Check if the file has a section about state updates
    if grep -q "git add orchestrator-state.json\|git commit.*orchestrator-state.json\|jq.*orchestrator-state.json" "$file"; then
        # Append validation note at the end of the file
        echo "" >> "$file"
        cat /tmp/validation_note.txt >> "$file"
    fi
    
    rm -f /tmp/validation_note.txt
}

# Process all orchestrator state rule files
for rules_file in /home/vscode/software-factory-template/agent-states/orchestrator/*/rules.md; do
    add_validation_note "$rules_file"
