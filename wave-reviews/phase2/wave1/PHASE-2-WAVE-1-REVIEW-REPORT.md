# Wave Architecture Review: Phase 2, Wave 1

## Review Summary
- **Date**: 2025-09-14T19:10:00Z
- **Reviewer**: Architect Agent (@agent-architect)
- **Wave Scope**: image-builder, gitea-client-split-001, gitea-client-split-002
- **Decision**: REQUIRE_SPLITS_BEFORE_PROCEED
- **Critical Finding**: MAJOR SIZE VIOLATIONS

## Integration Analysis
- **Branch Reviewed**: idpbuilder-oci-build-push/phase2/wave1/integration-20250914-185809
- **Total Changes**: ~5,566 lines (image-builder: 3646, split-001: 1378, split-002: 542)
- **Files Modified**: Multiple packages (pkg/build/, pkg/registry/)
- **Architecture Impact**: SEVERE - Size violations prevent clean trunk-based development

## Size Compliance Assessment (CRITICAL)

### Violation Summary
| Effort | Lines | % of Limit | Status | Required Action |
|--------|-------|------------|--------|-----------------|
| image-builder | 3646 | 456% | ❌ CRITICAL | Needs 6 splits |
| gitea-client-split-001 | 1378 | 172% | ❌ BOUNDARY VIOLATION | Split of split needed |
| gitea-client-split-002 | 542 | 68% | ✅ COMPLIANT | None |

**Severity**: 67% of efforts have MAJOR violations exceeding 170% of limit

### Boundary Violation Analysis
The gitea-client-split-001 situation is particularly concerning:
- This is already a SPLIT that was created to address size issues
- It STILL exceeds the limit by 72%
- Creates a "split of a split" anti-pattern
- Indicates fundamental planning failure

## Pattern Compliance

### Architecture Patterns
- ✅ API Design patterns: Properly implemented
- ✅ Data model patterns: Consistent with Phase 1
- ✅ Service layer patterns: Well-structured
- ❌ Size boundary patterns: SEVERELY VIOLATED

### Security Patterns
- ✅ Authentication patterns: Properly implemented in gitea-client
- ✅ Authorization patterns: Token handling appropriate
- ✅ Data protection patterns: TLS certificates handled correctly
- ✅ Input validation patterns: Present where needed

## System Integration
- ✅ Components integrate properly: Build and registry work together
- ✅ Dependencies resolved correctly: Phase 1 base properly integrated
- ✅ APIs compatible: No breaking changes detected
- ✅ Data flow correct: Image building to registry push flow works

## Performance Assessment
- **Scalability**: Acceptable - no major bottlenecks identified
- **Resource Usage**: Within reasonable bounds
- **Bottlenecks**: None detected in current implementation
- **Optimization Needed**: Minor - could benefit from caching

## R307/R308 Compliance Assessment

### R307 - Independent Branch Mergeability
**STATUS: ❌ VIOLATED**
- image-builder cannot merge independently (would create 6 PRs)
- gitea-client-split-001 cannot merge independently (needs further splitting)
- Only split-002 could merge to main independently
- **Impact**: Breaks trunk-based development principles

### R308 - Incremental Branching Strategy
**STATUS: ✅ COMPLIANT**
- Phase 2 Wave 1 correctly based on Phase 1 integration
- Sequential split dependencies properly maintained
- Integration branch created from correct base

## Issues Found

### CRITICAL (Requires Action Before Proceeding)
1. **Size Violations**: image-builder at 456% of limit
   - Impact: Cannot create clean PR, violates CD principles
   - Required: Split into 6 separate efforts

2. **Boundary Violation**: gitea-client-split-001 at 172% of limit
   - Impact: Split that needs splitting (anti-pattern)
   - Required: Further split into 2 efforts

### MAJOR (Should Address)
1. **Planning Failure**: Original estimates severely underestimated complexity
   - Impact: Cascading split requirements
   - Recommendation: Review estimation process

### MINOR (Advisory)
1. **Test Coverage**: Integration tests could be more comprehensive
2. **Documentation**: README updates needed for new features

## Technical Quality Assessment

Despite size violations, the technical implementation is solid:
- ✅ Build passes after fixes
- ✅ Demos execute successfully
- ✅ Integration mechanically successful
- ✅ Conflict resolution handled properly
- ✅ Feature functionality verified

## Decision Rationale

### Decision: REQUIRE_SPLITS_BEFORE_PROCEED

While the integration is technically successful and features work correctly, the SEVERE size violations (456% and 172% of limit) create unacceptable risks:

1. **CD Pipeline Risk**: PRs this large will fail automated checks
2. **Review Quality**: Cannot properly review 3600+ line changes
3. **Rollback Risk**: Large changes are difficult to revert
4. **Merge Conflict Risk**: Large PRs create integration bottlenecks
5. **Trunk-Based Development**: Violates core R307 principle

The fact that a split (gitea-client-split-001) itself needs splitting indicates a systemic planning problem that must be addressed.

## Required Actions Before Proceeding

### Immediate Requirements
1. **Split image-builder into 6 efforts**:
   - Each <800 lines
   - Maintain functional boundaries
   - Ensure independent mergeability

2. **Split gitea-client-split-001 into 2 efforts**:
   - Address the boundary violation
   - Each <800 lines
   - Maintain sequential dependencies

3. **Re-integrate after splits**:
   - Delete current integration branch
   - Create new integration with compliant splits
   - Verify each split can merge independently

### Process Improvements Needed
1. Review estimation methodology
2. Implement earlier size checks during development
3. Consider more granular initial planning

## Recommendations for Split Implementation

### Image-Builder Split Strategy (6 parts)
1. Core image builder interfaces and types
2. Build context management
3. Layer management and caching
4. Certificate generation for images
5. Push operations and retry logic
6. Integration and utilities

### Gitea-Client-Split-001 Split Strategy (2 parts)
1. Core Gitea types and authentication
2. Repository operations and utilities

## Next Steps

### IF SPLITS IMPLEMENTED:
1. Create split plans with Code Reviewer
2. Implement splits sequentially
3. Review each split independently
4. Re-integrate with compliant efforts
5. Re-review for compliance

### IF PROCEEDING WITHOUT SPLITS (NOT RECOMMENDED):
1. Document acceptance of technical debt
2. Create immediate backlog items for refactoring
3. Plan retroactive splits in Wave 2
4. Accept CD pipeline failures

## Risk Assessment

### Current Risks
- **HIGH**: CD pipeline rejection of oversized PRs
- **HIGH**: Poor review quality due to size
- **MEDIUM**: Integration bottlenecks
- **MEDIUM**: Difficult rollback scenarios

### Mitigation Required
- Implement splits before any production deployment
- Ensure all future efforts respect size limits
- Add automated size checking to development workflow

## Conclusion

Phase 2 Wave 1 demonstrates good technical implementation but FAILS architectural review due to severe size violations. The effort sizes (456% and 172% of limit) are unacceptable for trunk-based development and continuous delivery.

**The wave cannot proceed to Wave 2 until size compliance is achieved.**

While the features work correctly and integration is mechanically successful, the architectural integrity of the system requires maintaining manageable, independently-mergeable units of work. The current state violates this fundamental principle.

## Addendum for Remediation

When implementing the required splits:
1. Maintain clear functional boundaries
2. Ensure each split is independently testable
3. Document dependencies between splits
4. Verify each can merge to main without others
5. Consider feature flags for partial functionality

The technical quality of the implementation is good - this is purely an architectural/structural issue that must be resolved to maintain system integrity and development velocity.
