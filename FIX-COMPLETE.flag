====================================================

Completed at: 2025-09-15 12:42:55 UTC
Effort: gitea-client-split-002
Branch: idpbuilder-oci-build-push/phase2/wave1/gitea-client-split-002
Fix Plan: INTEGRATION_FIX_PLAN_20250915-123252.md

FIXES APPLIED:

✅ CRITICAL: R320 Violation - Stub Removal
   - Moved MockRegistry, MockRepository, MockImage from pkg/registry/stubs.go to pkg/registry/mocks_test.go
   - Deleted pkg/registry/stubs.go completely
   - Verified production build excludes test/mock code
   - All tests in registry package continue to pass

✅ Context.TODO() Usage Fixed
   - Fixed 4 instances of context.TODO() in pkg/cmd/get/clusters.go
   - Updated function signatures to accept and propagate context:
     * populateClusterList(ctx context.Context)
     * findExternalHTTPSPort(ctx context.Context, ...)
     * findInternalKubeApiPort(ctx context.Context, ...)
   - Replaced context.TODO() with proper context from cmd.Context()

VERIFICATION RESULTS:

✅ Production Build: go build ./... - SUCCESS
✅ Registry Tests: go test ./pkg/registry/ - PASS
✅ Mock Symbols Check: strings binary | grep Mock - NONE FOUND
✅ Stub Pattern Check: grep "not.*implemented" - ONLY LEGITIMATE TODOs

FILES MODIFIED:
- pkg/registry/stubs.go -> DELETED
- pkg/registry/mocks_test.go -> CREATED (test-only mock implementations)
- pkg/cmd/get/clusters.go -> UPDATED (context propagation)

STATUS: ALL INTEGRATION BLOCKING ISSUES RESOLVED

The R320 violation that blocked integration has been fully addressed.
Mock implementations are now properly isolated to test files only.
Context handling follows Go best practices.
Production builds are clean of test/mock artifacts.
