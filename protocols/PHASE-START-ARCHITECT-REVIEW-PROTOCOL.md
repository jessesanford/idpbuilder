# Phase Start Architect Review Protocol

## CRITICAL: Feature Completeness Review Before Each Phase

### Overview
BEFORE starting each new phase, the orchestrator MUST spawn @agent-architect-reviewer to assess whether the implementation is on track to deliver feature-complete functionality. This is a GO/NO-GO gate that can STOP the entire implementation if we're drifting from the original goals.

### Prerequisites
The previous phase must have:
1. ‚úÖ Passed functional tests per PHASE-COMPLETION-FUNCTIONAL-TESTING.md
2. ‚úÖ Created integration branch successfully
3. ‚úÖ Received architect approval

## Purpose of Phase Start Review

This review ensures:
1. We're building toward feature-complete functionality, not just individual components
2. Previous phases delivered expected functionality and passed tests
3. Integration points are materializing as planned
4. No critical features have been missed or descoped
5. The final result will meet original requirements
6. Previous phase functional tests have been executed and passed

## When Phase Start Review is Required

### Mandatory Review Points
```yaml
phase_start_gates:
  phase2_start:
    after: phase1_complete
    prerequisite: "Phase 1 functional tests PASSED"
    review: "Are APIs sufficient for full functionality?"
    critical: "Do we have all types needed?"
  
  phase3_start:
    after: phase2_complete
    prerequisite: "Phase 2 functional tests PASSED"
    review: "Does business logic provide complete functionality?"
    critical: "Any missing service logic?"
  
  phase4_start:
    after: phase3_complete
    prerequisite: "Phase 3 functional tests PASSED"
    review: "Are integrations comprehensive enough?"
    critical: "Will it handle all integration points?"
  
  phase5_start:
    after: phase4_complete
    prerequisite: "Phase 4 functional tests PASSED"
    review: "Are all features implemented?"
    critical: "Any gaps preventing production use?"
```

## Orchestrator Workflow for Phase Start

### Step 1: Before Starting New Phase

```python
def start_new_phase(phase_number):
    """
    MUST review progress before starting any phase
    """
    if phase_number > 1:  # No review before Phase 1
        # First verify functional tests passed
        previous_phase = phase_number - 1
        test_results = check_functional_test_results(previous_phase)
        
        if test_results != "PASSED":
            print(f"‚õî CANNOT START PHASE {phase_number} - Phase {previous_phase} tests not passed")
            print("Run functional tests per PHASE-COMPLETION-FUNCTIONAL-TESTING.md")
            sys.exit(1)
        
        print(f"‚úÖ Phase {previous_phase} functional tests PASSED")
        print(f"üîç Phase {phase_number} Start Gate - Architect Review Required")
        architect_decision = trigger_phase_start_review(phase_number)
        
        if architect_decision == "STOP":
            print("‚õî CANNOT START PHASE - Off track from goals")
            handle_off_track_situation()
            sys.exit(1)
        elif architect_decision == "PROCEED_WITH_CORRECTIONS":
            apply_course_corrections()
        # else PROCEED
```

### Step 2: Spawn Architect for Progress Assessment

```markdown
Task for @agent-architect-reviewer:

PURPOSE: Assess progress toward feature-complete functionality before Phase ${NEXT_PHASE}

PREREQUISITE VERIFICATION:
Phase ${PREVIOUS_PHASE} functional tests status: ${TEST_STATUS}
- If not PASSED, cannot proceed to Phase ${NEXT_PHASE}

CRITICAL ASSESSMENT REQUIRED:
You must determine if we're ON TRACK or OFF TRACK for delivering feature-complete functionality.

MANDATORY STARTUP:
1. Print: "PHASE START ARCHITECTURAL ASSESSMENT"
2. State: "Evaluating progress toward feature-complete functionality"
3. Verify: "Phase ${PREVIOUS_PHASE} functional tests: ${TEST_STATUS}"

READ THESE DOCUMENTS:
1. PROJECT-IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN.md (original goals)
2. orchestrator-state.yaml (current progress)
3. /workspaces/tests/phase${PREVIOUS_PHASE}-functional/test-results.log (if exists)
4. ALL previous architect reviews

PHASES COMPLETED SO FAR:
${LIST_COMPLETED_PHASES_WITH_SUMMARY}

THINK DEEPLY ABOUT:
1. Functional test results from previous phase:
   - Did all features pass testing?
   - Were there any test failures that need addressing?
   - Is the integration stable enough to build upon?

2. Original feature requirements:
   - Core functionality goals
   - Performance requirements
   - Integration requirements
   - User experience requirements

3. What has been delivered:
   - Which features are complete and tested?
   - Which are partially done?
   - Which haven't been started?

4. Trajectory analysis:
   - At current pace, will we achieve feature completeness?
   - Are we building the RIGHT things?
   - Any critical features being missed?

5. Integration reality:
   - Will the pieces actually work together?
   - Any architectural decisions preventing feature completion?
   - Did functional tests prove integration works?

PROVIDE ASSESSMENT:
- ON_TRACK: Proceeding will achieve feature-complete functionality
- NEEDS_CORRECTION: Adjustments required but recoverable
- OFF_TRACK: STOP IMMEDIATELY - Cannot achieve goals on current path

If OFF_TRACK, create detailed report on WHY.
```

## Assessment Decision Types

### 1. ON_TRACK - Green Light to Proceed

```markdown
# Phase Start Assessment - Phase ${NEXT_PHASE}
Date: ${DATE}
Reviewer: @agent-kcp-architect-reviewer
Assessment: ON_TRACK

## Feature Completeness Progress

### Required TMC Features (from original plan)
| Feature | Status | Confidence |
|---------|--------|------------|
| Multi-cluster workload management | ‚úÖ APIs done, controllers next | HIGH |
| Cross-cluster placement | ‚úÖ Types defined | HIGH |
| Workload scheduling | ‚è≥ Phase 2 will deliver | HIGH |
| Resource synchronization | ‚è≥ Phase 3 syncer | HIGH |
| Status aggregation | ‚è≥ Phase 3 | MEDIUM |
| Multi-tenancy | ‚úÖ Preserved throughout | HIGH |

### Progress Assessment
- Phase 1: Delivered 100% of planned APIs
- Phase 2: Will deliver controllers as designed
- Trajectory: On target for feature completeness

### Risk Assessment
- Technical Risk: LOW
- Feature Gap Risk: LOW
- Integration Risk: MEDIUM (manageable)

## Conclusion
Current implementation trajectory will achieve feature-complete KCP+TMC.
Proceed with Phase ${NEXT_PHASE}.
```

### 2. NEEDS_CORRECTION - Course Adjustment Required

```markdown
# Phase Start Assessment - Phase ${NEXT_PHASE}
Date: ${DATE}
Reviewer: @agent-kcp-architect-reviewer
Assessment: NEEDS_CORRECTION

## Feature Completeness Analysis

### Gaps Identified
1. **Missing Feature**: Advanced scheduling policies
   - Required by: Original TMC spec
   - Current Plan: Not included
   - Impact: Reduced functionality

2. **Incomplete Feature**: Status aggregation
   - Required: Full status from all clusters
   - Current: Only basic status
   - Impact: Limited observability

### Course Corrections Required

#### Correction 1: Add Scheduling Policies
**Add to Phase ${NEXT_PHASE}**:
- New Effort: E${X}.${Y}.${Z} - Advanced Scheduling
- Implementation: Port from contrib-tmc
- Size: ~600 lines

#### Correction 2: Enhance Status Aggregation
**Modify in Phase 3**:
- Enhance E3.3.2 to include full status
- Add status transformer logic
- Additional tests required

## Implementation Adjustments

CREATE: PHASE${NEXT_PHASE}-COURSE-CORRECTION-${DATE}.md

This document contains specific changes to incorporate missing features.

## Risk if Not Corrected
- Will not achieve feature parity with original TMC
- Users cannot use advanced placement
- Reduced operational visibility

## Conclusion
With specified corrections, can still achieve feature completeness.
MUST incorporate corrections before proceeding.
```

### 3. OFF_TRACK - STOP IMMEDIATELY

```markdown
# Phase Start Assessment - Phase ${NEXT_PHASE}
Date: ${DATE}
Reviewer: @agent-kcp-architect-reviewer
Assessment: OFF_TRACK - STOP IMMEDIATELY

## ‚õî CRITICAL: CANNOT ACHIEVE FEATURE-COMPLETE TMC

### Executive Summary
Current implementation has diverged significantly from feature-complete TMC goals.
Continuing will NOT deliver required functionality.

## Critical Gaps Analysis

### 1. Fundamental Architecture Mismatch
**Required**: Transparent multi-cluster management
**Current Path**: Building workspace-isolated controllers
**Gap**: No cross-workspace coordination mechanism
**Impact**: CANNOT achieve transparent multi-cluster

### 2. Missing Core Components
**Required Features NOT in Current Plan**:
- Cluster registration and discovery
- Cross-workspace placement engine
- Global resource aggregation
- Cluster health monitoring
- Workload migration support

**Percentage of TMC features covered**: 40%

### 3. Integration Impossibility
**Issue**: Current API design prevents required integration
**Evidence**: 
- APIs assume single workspace
- No cluster identity preservation
- Status cannot aggregate across workspaces

## Root Cause Analysis

### Why We're Off Track
1. **Initial Misunderstanding**: 
   - Assumed workspace isolation was compatible with transparency
   - Reality: Transparency REQUIRES cross-workspace visibility

2. **Incremental Drift**:
   - Each phase made small compromises
   - Cumulative effect: Major feature gaps

3. **Missing Requirements**:
   - Original plan didn't capture cluster registration
   - No consideration for cluster federation

## Cannot Proceed Because

1. **Architectural Redesign Required**
   - Current foundation cannot support requirements
   - Would need to restart from Phase 1

2. **Missing 60% of Features**
   - Not incremental additions
   - Fundamental capabilities absent

3. **Integration Will Fail**
   - Components cannot work together for TMC
   - Would produce isolated features, not system

## Required Actions

### Option 1: Redesign and Restart
1. Stop current implementation
2. Redesign architecture for transparency
3. New Phase 1 with cross-workspace APIs
4. Estimated additional effort: 150+ efforts

### Option 2: Reduce Scope
1. Accept non-transparent multi-cluster
2. Document feature limitations
3. Continue with reduced goals
4. Deliver: Basic workload placement only

### Option 3: Pivot Strategy
1. Use different approach (e.g., Federation v2)
2. Abandon current implementation
3. Start fresh with proven pattern

## Recommendation
STOP current implementation immediately.
Conduct architecture review with stakeholders.
Decide between redesign, scope reduction, or pivot.

## Supporting Evidence

### Feature Comparison
| TMC Original Requirement | Current Implementation | Gap |
|-------------------------|----------------------|-----|
| Transparent placement | Workspace-bound | 100% |
| Cluster registration | Not included | 100% |
| Cross-cluster networking | Not planned | 100% |
| Global resource view | Workspace-isolated | 100% |
| Workload migration | No support | 100% |

### Code Analysis
Examined branches from Phases 1-${COMPLETED_PHASES}:
- No cluster identity concepts
- No cross-workspace clients
- No federation primitives

## Conclusion
Current trajectory will deliver ~40% of TMC functionality.
This is NOT feature-complete TMC.
MUST STOP and reassess approach.
```

## Orchestrator Response to Assessment

### For ON_TRACK
```python
if assessment == "ON_TRACK":
    log_assessment("Phase proceeding - on track for feature completeness")
    start_phase_implementation()
```

### For NEEDS_CORRECTION
```python
if assessment == "NEEDS_CORRECTION":
    corrections = read_course_corrections()
    
    # Update phase plans
    for correction in corrections:
        update_phase_plan(correction)
    
    # Notify all agents
    broadcast_to_agents("Course corrections applied - see updated plans")
    
    # Proceed with corrections
    start_phase_implementation_with_corrections()
```

### For OFF_TRACK
```python
if assessment == "OFF_TRACK":
    print("‚õî‚õî‚õî IMPLEMENTATION STOPPED ‚õî‚õî‚õî")
    print("Cannot achieve feature-complete TMC on current path")
    
    # Create detailed report
    report = create_off_track_report()
    
    # Notify stakeholders
    notify_stakeholders(report)
    
    # Present options
    print("Options:")
    print("1. Redesign and restart")
    print("2. Reduce scope") 
    print("3. Pivot to different approach")
    
    # FULL STOP
    sys.exit(1)
```

## Integration with State Management

### Update State File
```yaml
phase_assessments:
  - phase: 2
    date: "2025-08-21"
    assessment: "ON_TRACK"
    confidence: 0.95
    
  - phase: 3
    date: "2025-08-25"
    assessment: "NEEDS_CORRECTION"
    corrections_file: "PHASE3-COURSE-CORRECTION-20250825.md"
    confidence: 0.75
    
  - phase: 4
    date: "2025-08-30"
    assessment: "OFF_TRACK"
    stop_reason: "Cannot achieve feature completeness"
    report_file: "OFF-TRACK-REPORT-20250830.md"

feature_completeness_tracking:
  target_features: 25
  implemented_features: 10
  on_track_features: 8
  at_risk_features: 5
  missing_features: 2
```

## Critical Success Metrics

The architect MUST evaluate against these metrics:

1. **Feature Coverage**
   - Target: 100% of TMC features from gap analysis
   - Minimum viable: 85%
   - Below 70%: OFF_TRACK

2. **Integration Viability**
   - Can components work together?: YES/NO
   - If NO: OFF_TRACK

3. **Multi-Tenancy Preservation**
   - Maintained throughout?: YES/NO
   - If NO: OFF_TRACK

4. **Performance Feasibility**
   - Will it scale?: YES/MAYBE/NO
   - If NO: OFF_TRACK

5. **Timeline Reality**
   - Can complete in remaining phases?: YES/NO
   - If NO: NEEDS_CORRECTION or OFF_TRACK

## Accountability Chain

1. **Orchestrator**: MUST request assessment before each phase
2. **Architect**: MUST provide honest assessment
3. **Orchestrator**: MUST stop if OFF_TRACK
4. **All Agents**: MUST read course corrections

## Early Warning Signs

The architect should flag OFF_TRACK if seeing:
- Core features not in any phase plan
- Architectural decisions preventing features
- Integration points not materializing
- Workspace isolation preventing transparency
- No cluster identity concepts
- Missing federation primitives

## Documentation Requirements

Every phase start assessment MUST include:
1. Feature completeness percentage
2. Confidence level (0-1)
3. Risk assessment
4. Go/No-Go recommendation
5. If No-Go: Detailed explanation

This protocol ensures we catch trajectory problems EARLY, before wasting effort on an approach that won't deliver feature-complete TMC.
