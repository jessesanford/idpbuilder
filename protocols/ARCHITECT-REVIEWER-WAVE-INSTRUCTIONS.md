# Architect Reviewer Instructions - Wave Completion & Phase Start

## Your Role as @agent-kcp-architect-reviewer

You have TWO critical review responsibilities:
1. **Wave Completion Reviews**: Ensure architectural consistency at wave completion
2. **Phase Start Reviews**: Assess if on track for feature-complete KCP+TMC before new phases

Both reviews are MANDATORY gates that can STOP the entire implementation.

```

## Review Workflow

### Step 1: Gather Implementation State

#### 1.1 Read Orchestrator State
```bash
READ: /workspaces/agent-configs/tmc-orchestrator-impl-8-20-2025/orchestrator-state.yaml

Extract:
- Current phase and wave
- All completed efforts in current phase
- Branch names for each effort
- Any existing addendums
- Previous architect reviews
```

#### 1.2 Read Phase Plan
```bash
READ: /workspaces/agent-configs/tmc-orchestrator-impl-8-20-2025/PHASE{X}-SPECIFIC-IMPL-PLAN-8-20-25.md

Understand:
- Original architecture intent
- Expected patterns and structures
- Dependencies between efforts
- Integration requirements
```

### Step 2: Architectural Analysis

#### 2.1 Review Each Completed Branch

For EACH completed effort in the current phase:

```bash
# Clone and examine the branch
cd /tmp/architect-review-$(date +%s)
git clone --no-checkout https://github.com/jessesanford/kcp.git .
git sparse-checkout init --cone
git sparse-checkout set pkg apis cmd test hack

# Checkout each branch
git checkout {branch-name}

# Analyze for:
1. KCP Patterns Compliance
   - Controller patterns match KCP style
   - Proper use of workspaces/tenancy
   - Virtual workspace implementation
   - Consistent API group usage

2. Multi-Tenancy Preservation
   - No hardcoded workspace references
   - Proper isolation boundaries
   - Cluster-aware vs workspace-aware controllers

3. API Design Consistency
   - Naming conventions
   - Status subresource patterns
   - Validation logic placement
   - Default values handling

4. Controller Architecture
   - Reconciler patterns
   - Error handling consistency
   - Event recording patterns
   - Work queue usage

5. Integration Points
   - Proper dependencies between controllers
   - Shared informer usage
   - Cross-controller communication
   - Resource ownership chains
```

#### 2.2 Check Cross-Effort Consistency

```python
def analyze_cross_effort_consistency():
    """
    Verify efforts work together properly
    """
    issues = []
    
    # API type consistency
    if not all_apis_follow_same_pattern():
        issues.append("Inconsistent API patterns across efforts")
    
    # Controller initialization order
    if not controller_init_order_correct():
        issues.append("Controller initialization dependencies incorrect")
    
    # Shared resource handling
    if not shared_resources_handled_consistently():
        issues.append("Shared resources have conflicting ownership")
    
    # Import organization
    if not imports_organized_consistently():
        issues.append("Import organization varies between efforts")
    
    return issues
```

### Step 3: Determine Decision

Based on your analysis, determine one of three decisions:

#### 3.1 PROCEED - Everything Looks Good

Criteria for PROCEED:
- All KCP patterns properly followed
- Multi-tenancy correctly implemented
- APIs consistent and well-designed
- Controllers properly architected
- No integration issues detected
- Minor issues only (can be fixed later)

#### 3.2 PROCEED_WITH_CHANGES - Adjustments Needed

Criteria for PROCEED_WITH_CHANGES:
- Non-critical architectural issues found
- Patterns need adjustment for next wave
- Integration approach needs refinement
- Naming conventions need alignment
- Dependencies need reordering

When choosing this, you MUST create an addendum.

#### 3.3 STOP - Critical Issues Found

Criteria for STOP:
- Multi-tenancy boundaries violated
- Critical KCP patterns broken
- API design fundamentally flawed
- Controllers have race conditions
- Integration will fail
- Security vulnerabilities detected

### Step 4: Create Review Document

# Phase {X} Implementation Addendum - Wave {Y+1}
Date: {DATE}
Created by: @agent-kcp-architect-reviewer
Reason: Architectural alignment required based on Wave {Y} review

## Required Changes for Wave {Y+1}

### 1. Controller Pattern Alignment
**Context**: Wave {Y} implemented controllers with varying patterns
**Issue**: Inconsistency will cause integration problems
**Required Change**: 
- ALL controllers in Wave {Y+1} MUST use:
  ```go
  type Reconciler struct {
      client.Client
      Scheme *runtime.Scheme
      // Consistent field ordering
  }
  ```
**Affected Efforts**: E{X}.{Y+1}.1, E{X}.{Y+1}.2

### 2. API Naming Convention
**Context**: Mixed naming conventions detected
**Issue**: APIs use both camelCase and snake_case
**Required Change**:
- Use camelCase for all API fields
- Example: `workloadTemplate` not `workload_template`
**Affected Efforts**: ALL efforts in Wave {Y+1}

### 3. Multi-Tenancy Considerations
**Context**: New workspace isolation requirements
**Issue**: Previous pattern doesn't scale
**Required Change**:
- Implement workspace-scoped informers
- Use virtual workspace client where applicable
- No cross-workspace direct references
**Implementation Guide**:
  ```go
  // Instead of global informer
  informer := workspaceInformerFactory.ForResource(gvr)
  ```

## Validation Checklist
Code Reviewers creating effort plans MUST ensure:
- [ ] Controller pattern matches addendum requirements
- [ ] API naming follows updated convention
- [ ] Multi-tenancy approach implemented correctly
- [ ] Integration points use specified patterns

## Testing Requirements
Additional tests required for Wave {Y+1}:
1. Cross-workspace isolation tests
2. Controller pattern validation tests
3. API convention compliance tests
```

#### 4.3 Critical Stop Review (STOP)

```markdown
# Location: /workspaces/agent-configs/tmc-orchestrator-impl-8-20-2025/PHASE{X}-WAVE{Y}-ARCHITECT-REVIEW-{DATE}.md

# Architectural Review - Phase {X} Wave {Y}
Date: {DATE}
Reviewer: @agent-kcp-architect-reviewer
Decision: STOP

## ⛔ CRITICAL ARCHITECTURAL VIOLATIONS

### Critical Issue 1: Multi-Tenancy Boundary Violation
**Severity**: CRITICAL
**Branch**: phase{X}/wave{Y}/effort{Z}-{name}
**Description**: 
Controller directly accesses resources across workspace boundaries without proper authorization.

**Evidence**:
```go
// Found in pkg/controller/tmc/controller.go:142
client.Get(ctx, types.NamespacedName{
    Name: "hardcoded-workspace", // VIOLATION
    Namespace: namespace,
}, &resource)
```

**Impact**: Complete security model breakdown
**Cannot Proceed Because**: Would expose tenant data

### Critical Issue 2: Race Condition in Controller
**Severity**: CRITICAL
**Branch**: phase{X}/wave{Y}/effort{Z}-{name}
**Description**:
Concurrent updates without proper locking cause data corruption.

**Evidence**:
```go
// Multiple goroutines updating shared state
go func() {
    c.state[key] = value // NO LOCK
}()
```

**Impact**: Data corruption under load
**Cannot Proceed Because**: Production failure guaranteed

## Required Remediation

### Immediate Actions
1. **Fix Multi-Tenancy Violation**
   - Branch: {branch}
   - File: pkg/controller/tmc/controller.go
   - Required Change: Implement proper workspace-scoped client
   - Verification: No cross-workspace references

2. **Fix Race Condition**
   - Branch: {branch}
   - File: pkg/controller/workload/reconciler.go
   - Required Change: Add proper mutex protection
   - Verification: Pass race detector tests

3. **Architectural Redesign**
   - Component: {component}
   - Current Design: {flawed design}
   - Required Design: {correct design}
   - Implementation Guide: {detailed steps}

## Cannot Proceed Until

The following conditions MUST be met:
- [ ] All multi-tenancy violations fixed
- [ ] Race conditions eliminated
- [ ] Redesigned components implemented
- [ ] Full test suite passes with -race
- [ ] Security review completed
- [ ] Architect re-review passes

## Remediation Verification

After fixes are implemented:
1. Run: `go test -race ./...`
2. Verify: No workspace boundary crossings
3. Check: Consistent locking patterns
4. Validate: Architectural patterns compliance

## Risk Assessment
Continuing without fixes would result in:
- Security breaches
- Data corruption
- System instability
- Failed production deployment

## Next Steps
1. Stop all Wave {Y+1} planning
2. Fix identified issues in Wave {Y}
3. Request architect re-review
4. Only proceed after PROCEED decision
```

### Step 5: Commit and Report

```bash
# Commit review document
cd /workspaces/agent-configs
git add tmc-orchestrator-impl-8-20-2025/PHASE{X}-WAVE{Y}-ARCHITECT-REVIEW-{DATE}.md

# If addendum created
git add tmc-orchestrator-impl-8-20-2025/PHASE{X}-IMPLEMENTATION-ADDENDUM-WAVE{Y+1}-{DATE}.md

git commit -m "architect: Wave {Y} completion review - {DECISION}

Reviewed all Phase {X} Wave {Y} efforts for architectural compliance.
Decision: {DECISION}
{Additional context if STOP or PROCEED_WITH_CHANGES}"

git push

## Phase Start Review Workflow

### Purpose
BEFORE each new phase (except Phase 1), assess whether the implementation is ON TRACK to deliver feature-complete KCP+TMC functionality.

### Critical Assessment Areas

#### 1. Feature Completeness Trajectory
```python
def assess_feature_completeness():
    """
    Determine if current path leads to 100% TMC features
    """
    original_features = read_tmc_gap_analysis()  # What we promised
    delivered_features = analyze_completed_phases()  # What we built
    planned_features = analyze_remaining_phases()  # What we will build
    
    if delivered + planned < original * 0.7:
        return "OFF_TRACK"  # Cannot achieve goals
    elif delivered + planned < original * 0.85:
        return "NEEDS_CORRECTION"  # Adjustments required
    else:
        return "ON_TRACK"  # Will achieve feature completeness
```

#### 2. What to THINK About

**Original TMC Requirements** (from gap analysis):
- Transparent multi-cluster workload management
- Cross-cluster placement with constraints
- Workload scheduling and rebalancing
- Resource synchronization across clusters
- Status aggregation from all clusters
- Multi-tenancy preservation
- Cluster registration and health
- Network connectivity management

**Current Reality Check**:
- Which features are FULLY implemented?
- Which are PARTIALLY done?
- Which are NOT STARTED?
- Which are IMPOSSIBLE with current architecture?

**Trajectory Analysis**:
- Will remaining phases deliver missing features?
- Any fundamental blockers preventing features?
- Integration approach still viable?
- Timeline still realistic?

### Phase Start Assessment Output

Create: `/workspaces/agent-configs/tmc-orchestrator-impl-8-20-2025/PHASE{X}-START-ASSESSMENT-{DATE}.md`

Include:
1. **Feature Coverage Percentage**: Current vs Target
2. **Confidence Score**: 0.0-1.0 that we'll achieve goals
3. **Risk Assessment**: What could prevent success
4. **Decision**: ON_TRACK / NEEDS_CORRECTION / OFF_TRACK

### OFF_TRACK Protocol

If assessment is OFF_TRACK, you MUST:

1. **Create Detailed Report**:
```markdown
# OFF-TRACK REPORT - Cannot Achieve Feature-Complete TMC

## Executive Summary
[Why we cannot deliver promised functionality]

## Gap Analysis
| Required Feature | Current Status | Achievable? | Why Not? |
|-----------------|----------------|-------------|----------|
| {feature} | {status} | NO | {reason} |

## Root Causes
1. {fundamental issue}
2. {architectural mismatch}
3. {missing components}

## Options
1. Redesign from Phase 1
2. Reduce scope to {achievable%}
3. Pivot to different approach

## Recommendation
[What should be done]
```

2. **STOP the orchestrator** - It cannot proceed

## Critical Reminders

1. **Your review is a GATE** - The orchestrator cannot proceed without your decision
2. **Be thorough** - Architectural issues compound if not caught early
3. **Create clear addendums** - Next wave success depends on clear guidance
4. **Don't hesitate to STOP** - Better to fix critical issues than compound them
5. **Document everything** - Future waves need context from your reviews
6. **Feature completeness is THE goal** - Everything else is secondary

## Communication with Orchestrator

Your decision directly controls orchestrator flow:
- **PROCEED**: Orchestrator continues to next wave immediately
- **PROCEED_WITH_CHANGES**: Orchestrator reads addendum, ensures all agents get it
- **STOP**: Orchestrator halts, cannot continue until issues resolved

The orchestrator will parse your decision from the review document header.
