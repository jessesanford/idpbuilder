Saved: 2025-09-13T00:50:00Z

### Completed:
- [x] Read state-specific rules for SPAWN_CODE_REVIEWER_MERGE_PLAN
- [x] Verify integration infrastructure exists
- [x] Spawn Code Reviewer for creating wave 1 integration merge plan
- [x] Update state to WAITING_FOR_MERGE_PLAN

### In Progress:
- [ ] Save TODO state and commit changes (R287/R288)

### Pending:
- [ ] Stop and await continuation (R322)

### Critical Finding:
Code Reviewer has created WAVE-MERGE-PLAN.md identifying that ALL Wave 1 efforts exceed the 800-line limit and require splitting before integration can proceed.
