Date: 2025-09-15 13:14:00 UTC

## Current Status:
- State: PHASE_INTEGRATION
- Phase: 2
- Integration Status: PENDING_START

## Completed Work:
- ✅ Phase 2 Wave 1 integration complete with all fixes
- ✅ Stub violations in gitea-client-split-002 resolved (R320 compliant)
- ✅ Wave integration branch pushed: idpbuilder-oci-build-push/phase2/wave1/integration-20250915-125755
- ✅ All 3 efforts successfully merged (image-builder, gitea-client-split-001, gitea-client-split-002)

## Next Steps on Restart:
1. Create proper Phase 2 integration infrastructure
2. Spawn Code Reviewer to create phase-level merge plan
3. Execute phase integration to combine:
   - Phase 1 work (already in phase1-integration)
   - Phase 2 Wave 1 work (with all fixes)
4. Verify complete Phase 2 integration
5. Prepare for architect review

## Important Notes:
- Phase 2 Wave 1 integration branch contains critical R320 fixes
- Must use correct base branch for phase integration
- Follow R282 for phase-level integration protocol
