# Orchestrator R327_CASCADE_ENFORCEMENT TODOs

## Completed Tasks:
✅ Identified wave integrations needing CASCADE recreation
✅ Deleted stale Phase 1 Wave 1 integration branch
✅ Deleted stale Phase 1 Wave 2 integration branch  
✅ Deleted stale Phase 1 integration branch (was incorrectly created)
✅ Gathered Wave 1 effort branches for integration
✅ Documented Wave 1 and Wave 2 requirements in R327-CASCADE-WAVE-REINTEGRATION-PLAN.md
✅ Updated orchestrator state to track R327 CASCADE
✅ Saved TODOs per R287

## Pending:
⏳ Commit state changes
⏳ STOP per R322 - ready for wave re-integrations

## R327 CASCADE Status:
- Wave 1 Integration: DELETED, ready for recreation
- Wave 2 Integration: DELETED, ready for recreation
- Phase 1 Integration: DELETED, will recreate after waves

## Next Actions (after user continuation):
1. Spawn Integration Agent for Wave 1 re-integration
2. Spawn Integration Agent for Wave 2 re-integration
3. CASCADE to Phase 1 integration

## Critical Notes:
- R327 SUPREME LAW violated - we tried to do phase integration without recreating waves
- Fixes from Sept 13-14 were NOT in wave integrations from Sept 12-13
- Must recreate ALL integrations in CASCADE order
