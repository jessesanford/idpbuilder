# Timestamp: 2025-09-12T03:30:00Z

## Completed Tasks
✅ Acknowledged rules and verified environment
✅ Analyzed effort branches and determined dependencies
✅ Checked Wave 2 effort branches  
✅ Analyzed branch commit history for dependencies
✅ Examined file changes in each effort
✅ Determined optimal merge order based on dependencies
✅ Identified potential conflicts between branches
✅ Created WAVE-MERGE-PLAN.md with exact instructions

## Plan Summary
- Created comprehensive merge plan for 8 effort branches
- Documented optimal merge order: kind-cert -> tls-trust -> auth-splits -> validation-splits -> fallback
- Identified potential conflicts in pkg/testutil, pkg/certs, go.mod
- Provided exact git commands for Integration Agent
- Included conflict resolution strategies

## Key Decisions
- Excluded parent branches for split efforts (R269)
- Used only original effort branches (R270)
- Ordered merges by dependency chain
- Documented R327 re-integration context
