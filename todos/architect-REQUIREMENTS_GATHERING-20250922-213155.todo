# Architect TODOs - Trigger: REQUIREMENTS_GATHERING_COMPLETE
# State: REQUIREMENTS_GATHERING
# Timestamp: 2025-09-22T21:36:00Z

## Completed Tasks:
1. ✅ Clone and analyze idpbuilder repository
   - Analyzed existing command structure (Cobra-based)
   - Identified get secrets command for credential retrieval
   - Understood project structure and patterns

2. ✅ Understand existing CLI structure and commands
   - Root command with create, delete, get, version subcommands
   - Get secrets retrieves gitea-credential with username/token
   - Uses standard Go patterns with cobra and client-go

3. ✅ Analyze go-containerregistry library requirements
   - Researched google/go-containerregistry API
   - Identified authentication patterns (Basic auth, keychain)
   - Understood transport configuration for insecure mode
   - Found examples of OCI push operations

4. ✅ Create comprehensive requirements document
   - Created REQUIREMENTS-ANALYSIS.md with full details
   - Included architecture design with interfaces
   - Detailed TDD test strategy
   - Phased implementation plan (4 phases, 6 waves)
   - Configuration templates for setup

## Key Findings:
- idpbuilder uses Cobra CLI framework
- Existing get secrets can provide default gitea credentials
- go-containerregistry provides clean OCI abstractions
- TDD approach requires ~4200 LOC across 4 phases
- Need strict RED-GREEN-REFACTOR cycles for each feature

## Recommendations for Orchestrator:
- Use the REQUIREMENTS-ANALYSIS.md to generate implementation plan
- Enforce TDD with tests written FIRST
- Leverage existing idpbuilder patterns
- Focus on OCI standards compliance
- Target 80%+ test coverage
