# Orchestrator TODOs - State: ERROR_RECOVERY
# Timestamp: 2025-09-06 20:29:45 UTC
# Previous State: MONITORING_INTEGRATION

## Completed Tasks
- [x] Check for integration report at efforts/phase1/wave1/integration-workspace/INTEGRATION-REPORT.md
- [x] Parse integration report for build/test/demo/integration status
- [x] Apply R291 gate enforcement to determine next state
- [x] Update orchestrator-state.yaml with new state and reason
- [x] Save TODOs per R287 before state transition

## Current Task
- [ ] Commit and push state changes per R288

## Pending Tasks
- [ ] Stop per R322 and await user continuation

## Context
- Transitioned to ERROR_RECOVERY due to R291 BUILD GATE FAILURE
- Integration completed but build failed due to upstream bugs:
  1. Duplicate function: isFeatureEnabled
  2. Duplicate type: CertValidator
  3. ValidationResult doesn't implement error interface
- Next actions: Fix duplicate declarations in effort code before re-integration
