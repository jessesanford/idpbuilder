# Code Reviewer TODOs - Trigger: PHASE_2_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN_COMPLETE
# State: EFFORT_PLAN_CREATION
# Effort: Phase 2 Implementation Planning
# Timestamp: 2025-09-07T23:47:00Z

## Completed Tasks:
✅ Read Phase 2 architecture plan from architect
✅ Analyzed architecture components and structure
✅ Created Phase 2 implementation plan document
✅ Defined Wave 1 efforts (E2.1.1 and E2.1.2) with full details
✅ Defined Wave 2 effort (E2.2.1) with CLI specifications
✅ Specified parallelization opportunities (Wave 1 can parallelize)
✅ Documented integration points with Phase 1 certificate infrastructure

## Phase 2 Implementation Plan Summary:
- Location: phase-plans/phase2/PHASE-2-IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN.md
- Total Efforts: 3 (2 in Wave 1, 1 in Wave 2)
- Wave 1: PARALLELIZABLE (E2.1.1 and E2.1.2 can run simultaneously)
- Wave 2: SEQUENTIAL (depends on Wave 1 completion)
- Base Branch: idpbuilder-oci-build-push/phase1/integration

## Key Decisions Made:
- E2.1.1 (Image Builder): 600 lines, uses go-containerregistry
- E2.1.2 (Registry Client): 600 lines, integrates Phase 1 certs
- E2.2.1 (CLI Commands): 500 lines, depends on both Wave 1 efforts
- All efforts include comprehensive test requirements (80% coverage)
- Clear interfaces defined for each component
