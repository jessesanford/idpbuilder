# Orchestrator TODO State
## Generated: 2025-09-09 04:17:00
## State: SPAWN_AGENTS (but file shows SPAWN_ARCHITECT_PHASE_ASSESSMENT)

### Completed Tasks:
✅ Read and acknowledge all state-specific rules for SPAWN_AGENTS state
✅ Create R290 verification marker for state rules acknowledgment
✅ Check Split-003 infrastructure status for gitea-client effort
✅ Analyze state inconsistency - Split-003 doesn't exist (only 2 splits needed)
✅ Check other Phase 2 efforts status - all complete
✅ Update state file - fix gitea-client split count from 3 to 2
✅ Note state file already shows SPAWN_ARCHITECT_PHASE_ASSESSMENT

### Findings:
- E2.1.1 (image-builder): COMPLETED and APPROVED
- E2.1.2 (gitea-client): 2 splits (not 3), both REVIEWED_APPROVED
- All Phase 2 Wave 1 efforts complete
- State file shows current_state: SPAWN_ARCHITECT_PHASE_ASSESSMENT
- Previous work already transitioned through INTEGRATION

### Current Status:
- No agents to spawn in SPAWN_AGENTS state (all work complete)
- State file indicates we're actually in SPAWN_ARCHITECT_PHASE_ASSESSMENT
- Need clarification on which state to execute

### Next Actions:
- Either continue with SPAWN_ARCHITECT_PHASE_ASSESSMENT state work
- Or await user clarification on state mismatch
