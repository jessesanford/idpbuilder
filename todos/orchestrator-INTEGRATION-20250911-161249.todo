# Orchestrator TODO State - Transition to INTEGRATION
# Saved at: 2025-09-11 20:12:00 UTC
# State: INTEGRATION_CODE_REVIEW → INTEGRATION

## Completed Tasks
✅ Execute mandatory pre-flight checks and rule acknowledgments
✅ Verify agent identity and acknowledge critical rules (R151, R217, R232, R290, etc.)
✅ Validate target repository configuration (R191)
✅ Check master implementation plan
✅ Load orchestrator state from file (R324)
✅ Determine current state and next actions
✅ Read state-specific rules for INTEGRATION_CODE_REVIEW (R290)
✅ Spawn Code Reviewer for Phase 1 Wave 2 integration review
✅ Handle critical issue: No integration exists to review
✅ Update state to INTEGRATION for actual integration setup

## Next Actions (for INTEGRATION state)
- Setup Phase 1 Wave 2 integration infrastructure
- Clone from phase1/wave1/integration base
- Spawn Code Reviewer to create merge plan
- Spawn Integration Agent to execute merges
- Monitor integration progress
- Once complete, spawn Code Reviewer for integration review
- Then request architect wave review

## Critical Issue Found
Code Reviewer discovered that Phase 1 Wave 2 integration was never performed.
State machine was incorrectly in INTEGRATION_CODE_REVIEW without actual integration.
Transitioning back to INTEGRATION state to perform the actual integration work.
