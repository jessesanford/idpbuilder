# Orchestrator TODO State - MONITOR_IMPLEMENTATION
# Timestamp: 2025-09-29T20:28:09Z
# Current State: MONITOR_IMPLEMENTATION
# Next State: SPAWN_CODE_REVIEWERS_FOR_REVIEW

## Completed Tasks:
- ✅ Reviewed orchestrator state and determined current implementation status
- ✅ Checked implementation status for E1.2.1, E1.2.2-split-001, and E1.2.3-split-001
- ✅ Updated orchestrator-state.json with completion status for split-001 efforts

## Monitoring Results:
- E1.2.2-split-001: IMPLEMENTATION_COMPLETE (519 lines)
- E1.2.3-split-001: IMPLEMENTATION_COMPLETE (552 lines)  
- E1.2.1: NO IMPLEMENTATION (stalled, needs investigation)

## Next Actions (for SPAWN_CODE_REVIEWERS_FOR_REVIEW state):
- Spawn Code Reviewers for E1.2.2-split-001 and E1.2.3-split-001
- Investigate E1.2.1 stalled implementation
- Continue with split-002 implementations after reviews

## State Transition:
- From: MONITOR_IMPLEMENTATION
- To: SPAWN_CODE_REVIEWERS_FOR_REVIEW
- Reason: Split-001 implementations complete, need review
