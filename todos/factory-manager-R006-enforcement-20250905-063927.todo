## Summary

Successfully enforced R006 (Orchestrator NEVER Writes Code) across all high-risk orchestrator states where code editing might be tempting. Each state now has:

1. Explicit R006 rule reference in PRIMARY DIRECTIVES
2. State-specific warnings about code editing temptations
3. Violation detection sections to catch attempts
4. Updated FORBIDDEN ACTIONS with R006 penalties

This will prevent future orchestrators from making excuses or attempting to edit code in these integration-heavy states.
