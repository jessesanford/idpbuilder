Date: 2025-09-09T21:04:00Z
State: COORDINATE_BUILD_FIXES
Agent: orchestrator

## Completed Tasks (ANALYZE_BUILD_FAILURES State)
✅ Performed agent identity verification
✅ Acknowledged critical rules from orchestrator config
✅ Verified environment and state files
✅ Validated target repository configuration (R191)
✅ Checked for master implementation plan
✅ Loaded orchestrator state and determined next actions
✅ Read ANALYZE_BUILD_FAILURES state rules (R290 mandatory)
✅ Analyzed the 3 test failures from production validation
✅ Created BUILD-ERROR-ANALYSIS.md documenting categorized errors
✅ Created ERROR-TO-EFFORT-MAP.md mapping errors to efforts
✅ Created BUILD-FAILURE-ANALYSIS-SUMMARY.md
✅ Created CODE-REVIEWER-FIX-PLANNING-BRIEF.md
✅ Spawned code reviewer to create fix plans for build failures
✅ Updated state file to next state before stopping (R324)
✅ Saved TODO state before stopping (R287)

## Next Tasks (COORDINATE_BUILD_FIXES State)
- [ ] Read COORDINATE_BUILD_FIXES state rules (R290)
- [ ] Spawn SW Engineers to implement the 3 fixes
- [ ] Monitor fix implementation progress
- [ ] Verify fixes resolve the test failures
- [ ] Transition to next appropriate state

## Context for Next Session
- Fix plans created at: efforts/project/integration-workspace/FIX-PLAN-PREEXISTING-TESTS.md
- 3 pre-existing test failures need fixing (not from our implementation)
- All fixes are to test files only, production binary already works
- Fixes can be parallelized (no dependencies between them)
