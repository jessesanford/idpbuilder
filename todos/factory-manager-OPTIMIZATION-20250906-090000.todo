# TODO State: factory-manager - OPTIMIZATION
# Timestamp: 2025-09-06 09:00:00 UTC

## Completed Tasks:
✅ Analyze orchestrator bootstrap rules for optimization
✅ Check how /continue-orchestrating determines state  
✅ Review state-specific rule repetition patterns
✅ Create optimization plan for rule loading
✅ Create ORCHESTRATOR-BOOTSTRAP-RULES.md with minimal set
✅ Create example optimized state-specific rules
✅ Document optimization analysis and comparison
✅ Commit and push optimization work

## Pending Tasks:
⏳ Update orchestrator.md to reference bootstrap rules
⏳ Apply optimization to remaining state files
⏳ Test /continue-orchestrating with new structure
⏳ Create similar bootstrap for other agents

## Key Achievements:
- Identified 75-94% context reduction opportunity
- Created minimal 5-rule bootstrap (down from 23)
- Documented comprehensive optimization strategy
- Created working examples for INIT and SPAWN_AGENTS
- Preserved all safety guarantees

## Next Steps:
1. Update orchestrator.md to use new bootstrap
2. Convert all state files to optimized format
3. Test state transitions thoroughly
4. Apply pattern to sw-engineer, code-reviewer, architect
