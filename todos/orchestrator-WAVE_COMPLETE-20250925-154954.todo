ORCHESTRATOR TODO STATE - WAVE_COMPLETE
========================================
Timestamp: 2025-09-25T15:49:40Z
State: Transitioning from WAVE_COMPLETE to INTEGRATION

COMPLETED:
✅ Verified all Phase 3 Wave 1 efforts have passed reviews
✅ Checked state-specific rules for WAVE_COMPLETE
✅ Analyzed base branches for Phase 3 Wave 1 efforts
✅ CRITICAL FINDING: R009 violation - all branches based on main instead of phase2/wave2/integration
✅ Documented violation in orchestrator-state.json
✅ Updated current_state to INTEGRATION

PENDING FOR INTEGRATION STATE:
- Create Phase 3 Wave 1 integration branch (with special handling for incorrect base)
- Need to merge Phase 2 Wave 2 integration changes first
- Then merge Phase 3 Wave 1 efforts
- Run tests on integrated code
- Spawn architect for wave review if needed

R009 VIOLATION RECOVERY NEEDED:
- Phase 3 Wave 1 branches are based on main
- They're missing all Phase 2 changes
- Integration will require incorporating Phase 2 first
