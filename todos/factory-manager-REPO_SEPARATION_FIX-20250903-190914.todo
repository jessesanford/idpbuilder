# Timestamp: 20250903-190914
# Trigger: Mid-work checkpoint per R287

## Current Progress

### âœ… COMPLETED TASKS:
1. Scanned all agent state directories to understand structure
2. Checked orchestrator planning-related states for R251/R309 references
3. Checked code-reviewer planning-related states for R251/R309 references
4. Checked sw-engineer implementation states for R251/R309 references
5. Fixed CREATE_NEXT_SPLIT_INFRASTRUCTURE - Added R251/R309
6. Fixed SPAWN_AGENTS - Added R251/R309
7. Fixed SPAWN_CODE_REVIEWERS_EFFORT_PLANNING - Added R251/R309
8. Fixed SW-Engineer IMPLEMENTATION - Added R251/R309
9. Fixed SW-Engineer SPLIT_IMPLEMENTATION - Added R251/R309
10. Fixed Code-Reviewer EFFORT_PLAN_CREATION - Added R251/R309
11. Fixed Code-Reviewer CREATE_SPLIT_PLAN - Added R251/R309
12. Fixed SPAWN_ENGINEERS_FOR_FIXES - Added R251/R309

### ðŸ”„ IN PROGRESS:
- Checking other critical orchestrator spawn states

### ðŸ“‹ PENDING TASKS:
1. Check and fix SPAWN_CODE_REVIEWERS_FOR_REVIEW
2. Check and fix SPAWN_INTEGRATION_AGENT
3. Check and fix INTEGRATION state
4. Check and fix PHASE_INTEGRATION state
5. Check and fix FINAL_INTEGRATION state
6. Create comprehensive report of findings and fixes
7. Commit and push all changes

## Summary of Findings

### Critical Discovery:
Only SETUP_EFFORT_INFRASTRUCTURE had R251/R309 references originally.
All other planning/infrastructure/spawning states were missing these PARAMOUNT rules.

### States Fixed So Far:
- orchestrator/CREATE_NEXT_SPLIT_INFRASTRUCTURE âœ…
- orchestrator/SPAWN_AGENTS âœ…
- orchestrator/SPAWN_CODE_REVIEWERS_EFFORT_PLANNING âœ…
- orchestrator/SPAWN_ENGINEERS_FOR_FIXES âœ…
- sw-engineer/IMPLEMENTATION âœ…
- sw-engineer/SPLIT_IMPLEMENTATION âœ…
- code-reviewer/EFFORT_PLAN_CREATION âœ…
- code-reviewer/CREATE_SPLIT_PLAN âœ…

### States Still Need Checking:
- orchestrator/SPAWN_CODE_REVIEWERS_FOR_REVIEW
- orchestrator/SPAWN_INTEGRATION_AGENT
- orchestrator/INTEGRATION
- orchestrator/PHASE_INTEGRATION
- orchestrator/FINAL_INTEGRATION
- Other integration-related states

## Notes
This is a CRITICAL fix preventing agents from creating effort branches in the Software Factory repository, which would be catastrophic (-100% failure).
