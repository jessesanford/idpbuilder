# Context: Creating split plan for E1.2.2 registry client (877 lines over 800 limit)

## Completed Tasks
- [x] Complete E1.2.2 registry client split plan creation
- [x] Created SPLIT-SUMMARY.md with detailed 2-part split strategy  
- [x] Split design: E1.2.2 (427 lines core) + E1.2.2a (450 lines advanced)
- [x] Validated both splits under 800 line limit with safe buffers
- [x] Documented sequential execution protocol and dependencies

## Context
- Branch: phase1/wave2/effort2-registry-client
- Current size: 877 lines (77 over limit)
- Split strategy: 2 parts with logical functional grouping
- E1.2.2: Core client interfaces and basic functionality
- E1.2.2a: Advanced auth, TLS, and comprehensive testing

## Files Created
- /home/vscode/workspaces/idpbuilder/efforts/phase1/wave2/effort2-registry-client/SPLIT-SUMMARY.md

## Next Steps
- Ready for orchestrator to execute sequential split implementation
- E1.2.2 must complete first (provides foundation)
- E1.2.2a follows (extends and tests)
