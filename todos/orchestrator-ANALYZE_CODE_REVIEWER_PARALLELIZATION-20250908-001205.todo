ORCHESTRATOR TODO STATE - ANALYZE_CODE_REVIEWER_PARALLELIZATION
Timestamp: 2025-09-08T00:35:00Z

COMPLETED:
✅ Read Phase 2 Wave 1 Implementation Plan with Read tool
✅ Extract parallelization metadata from the plan  
✅ Create Code Reviewer parallelization plan
✅ Save parallelization plan to orchestrator-state.yaml
✅ Output parallelization acknowledgment
✅ Update state to SPAWN_CODE_REVIEWERS_EFFORT_PLANNING (in progress)

PARALLELIZATION DECISION SAVED:
- Phase 2 Wave 1: Both efforts (E2.1.1, E2.1.2) can parallelize
- Strategy: Spawn both Code Reviewers together in ONE message
- R151 compliance: <5s delta required
