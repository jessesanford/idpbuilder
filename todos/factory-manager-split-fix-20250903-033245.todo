# Factory Manager - Split Infrastructure Just-In-Time Fix
Date: 2025-09-03
Status: COMPLETED

## Completed Tasks:
1. ✅ Understood the current split infrastructure creation flow
   - Found issue in MONITOR state creating all splits at once
   - Identified violation of sequential split principle

2. ✅ Searched for where split infrastructure is currently created
   - Located in orchestrator MONITOR state rules
   - Found in R204 rule definition

3. ✅ Analyzed state machine transitions for splits
   - No existing state for incremental split creation
   - MONITOR → SPAWN_AGENTS flow insufficient

4. ✅ Designed solution for just-in-time split creation
   - Add CREATE_NEXT_SPLIT_INFRASTRUCTURE state
   - Create one split at a time, sequentially

5. ✅ Added CREATE_NEXT_SPLIT_INFRASTRUCTURE state to state machine
   - Updated SOFTWARE-FACTORY-STATE-MACHINE.md
   - Added transitions and state definition

6. ✅ Updated R204 to enforce sequential just-in-time creation
   - Changed from "create ALL" to "create JUST-IN-TIME"
   - Emphasized sequential dependency

7. ✅ Updated orchestrator MONITOR state to handle sequential splits
   - Added detection for next split needed
   - Transition to CREATE_NEXT_SPLIT_INFRASTRUCTURE

8. ✅ Created state rules for CREATE_NEXT_SPLIT_INFRASTRUCTURE
   - Complete rules.md file with implementation
   - Tracking and transition logic

9. ✅ Documented the solution clearly
   - Created SPLIT-INFRASTRUCTURE-JUST-IN-TIME-FIX.md
   - Comprehensive explanation with examples

10. ✅ Committed and pushed all changes
    - All files updated and persisted
    - Solution fully implemented

## Key Changes:
- New state: CREATE_NEXT_SPLIT_INFRASTRUCTURE
- R204 updated for just-in-time creation
- MONITOR state detects and transitions appropriately
- Complete documentation of solution

## Impact:
- Fixes critical split measurement bug
- Ensures sequential split dependencies
- Prevents -100% grading penalty
- Enables correct line counting for splits
