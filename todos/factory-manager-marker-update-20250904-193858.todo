# Marker File Update - Completed Tasks

## Completed:
1. ✅ Searched for all marker file patterns in the codebase
2. ✅ Identified state verification markers (.state_rules_read_*)
3. ✅ Identified completion signal files (actually uses state file updates, not files)
4. ✅ Updated IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN locations to new structure
5. ✅ Updated CODE-REVIEW-REPORT locations to new structure
6. ✅ Verified SPLIT-PLAN already uses new structure
7. ✅ Updated detection patterns for backward compatibility
8. ✅ Created comprehensive documentation (docs/MARKER-FILE-STRUCTURE.md)
9. ✅ Tested backward compatibility approach with symlinks
10. ✅ Committed and pushed all changes to planning-file-reorg branch

## Key Changes Made:
- Updated Code Reviewer EFFORT_PLANNING to create plans in .software-factory/ structure
- Updated Orchestrator MONITOR to instruct reviewers to use new structure
- Updated Orchestrator WAITING_FOR_EFFORT_PLANS to check both locations
- Created documentation explaining the new structure and migration strategy
- Added utility scripts for potential future use

## Backward Compatibility:
- All new files use timestamped names in .software-factory/ directories
- Symlinks created to legacy locations for compatibility
- Detection patterns check new location first, then fall back to legacy
