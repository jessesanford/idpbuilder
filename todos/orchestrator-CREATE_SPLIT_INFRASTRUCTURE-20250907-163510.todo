# Orchestrator TODO State - RESET TO PRE-SPLIT
# Generated: 2025-09-07 16:32:00 UTC
# State: CREATE_SPLIT_INFRASTRUCTURE
# Status: Split plan exists, infrastructure needed

## ✅ Completed Tasks
- All split directories removed (SPLIT-001, SPLIT-002, SPLIT-003)
- All local split branches deleted
- All remote split branches deleted
- State reset to post-review, pre-infrastructure

## 📋 Current State
- E1.2.1 identified as needing splits (808 lines > 800 limit)
- Split plan EXISTS at: efforts/phase1/wave2/cert-validation/SPLIT-PLAN.md
- 3 splits planned:
  - Split 001: Core Types & Errors (~200 lines)
  - Split 002: Certificate Validator (~350 lines)
  - Split 003: Chain Validator & Tests (~350 lines)
- NO infrastructure created yet
- NO split branches exist
- Ready to create fresh split infrastructure

## 🎯 Next Actions When Resumed
1. Create infrastructure for split-001
2. Spawn SW Engineer for split-001 implementation
3. After split-001 complete, create infrastructure for split-002
4. Continue sequentially through all 3 splits
5. Ensure each split stays under 400 lines

## 📝 Notes
- Previous attempt had split-003 at 2038 lines (major violation)
- Need to ensure SW Engineers only implement their specific split files
- Must not duplicate code from previous splits
