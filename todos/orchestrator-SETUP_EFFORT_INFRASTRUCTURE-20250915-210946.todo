================================================================
Timestamp: 2025-09-15T21:09:30Z
State: Transitioning from SETUP_EFFORT_INFRASTRUCTURE to ANALYZE_CODE_REVIEWER_PARALLELIZATION

âœ… COMPLETED:
1. Read and acknowledged all PRIMARY DIRECTIVE rules for SETUP_EFFORT_INFRASTRUCTURE
2. Created R290 verification marker file
3. Loaded target repository configuration (R191)
4. Set up infrastructure for E2.2.2-B (image-operations)
   - Cloned from credential-management branch (intra-wave dependency)
   - Created branch: idpbuilder-oci-build-push/phase2/wave2/image-operations
   - Pushed to remote
   - Locked git config (R312)
   - Created work-log.md
5. Updated orchestrator-state.json with infrastructure details
6. Transitioned to ANALYZE_CODE_REVIEWER_PARALLELIZATION state (R234)

ðŸ“‹ NEXT STEPS (in ANALYZE_CODE_REVIEWER_PARALLELIZATION):
- Analyze E2.2.2-B to determine if Code Reviewer can be spawned in parallel
- Since only one effort (E2.2.2-B) needs planning, likely sequential spawn
- After analysis, transition to SPAWN_CODE_REVIEWERS_EFFORT_PLANNING
