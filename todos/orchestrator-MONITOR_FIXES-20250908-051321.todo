# Orchestrator TODO State - MONITOR_FIXES
# Saved: 2025-09-08 05:08:00 UTC

## Completed Tasks:
- ✅ Monitor E2.1.1 R320 fix completion status - FIXES COMPLETE
- ✅ Monitor E2.1.2 Split 001 completion status - IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE
- ✅ Check for fix completion markers in effort directories - FOUND
- ✅ Spawn Code Reviewer for E2.1.1 re-review after R320 fixes - APPROVED
- ✅ Spawn Code Reviewer for E2.1.2 Split 001 review - NEEDS SUB-SPLIT

## Current Situation:
- E2.1.1: APPROVED (601 lines, R320 compliant, ready for integration)
- E2.1.2 Split-001: SIZE VIOLATION (1206 lines = 629 production + 692 tests)
  - Needs sub-split into Split-001a (production) and Split-001b (tests)

## Next Actions:
- Handle E2.1.2 Split-001 sub-split infrastructure
- Create Split-001a for production code only
- Create Split-001b for test code only  
- Spawn engineers sequentially for sub-splits
- After all splits complete, proceed with integration

## Critical Note:
E2.1.2 Split-001 exceeded size limit due to test code not being accounted for.
Sub-split plan created by Code Reviewer.
