# Orchestrator TODO State - ERROR_RECOVERY Transition
# Saved: 2025-09-14T23:21:00Z
# Previous State: WAITING_FOR_PHASE_ASSESSMENT
# Next State: ERROR_RECOVERY
# Reason: Phase 2 assessment returned NEEDS_WORK

## Completed Tasks:
- ✅ Perform pre-flight checks and rule acknowledgments
- ✅ Verify environment and configuration
- ✅ Load and verify current state from orchestrator-state.json
- ✅ Check for phase assessment report from architect
- ✅ Process architect assessment decision (NEEDS_WORK)
- ✅ Update state file with assessment results

## ERROR_RECOVERY Context:
- Source: PHASE_ASSESSMENT_NEEDS_WORK
- Priority: CRITICAL
- Issue: Phase 2 build and push functionality not implemented
- Report: phase-assessments/phase2/PHASE-2-ASSESSMENT-REPORT.md

## Required Actions in ERROR_RECOVERY:
1. Implement E2.1.1 - Image Builder (<800 lines)
2. Implement E2.1.2 - Registry Client (<800 lines)
3. Implement E2.2.1 - CLI Commands
4. Enforce size compliance strictly
5. Re-run full phase integration after implementation

## Phase 2 Status:
- Core functionality (OCI build/push): MISSING
- Integration branch: Contains only Phase 1 code
- Size violations: Acknowledged but not resolved
- MVP readiness: BLOCKED
