## Orchestrator TODOs - Phase 1 Wave 2 Integration Setup
Timestamp: 2025-09-11 16:42:00 UTC
Agent: orchestrator
State: INTEGRATION (Phase 1 Wave 2)

### Pending Tasks:
1. Setup Phase 1 Wave 2 integration infrastructure
2. Clone target repository with phase1/wave1/integration as base branch
3. Create phase1/wave2/integration branch
4. Spawn Code Reviewer to create Wave 2 merge plan
5. Wait for merge plan completion
6. Spawn Integration Agent to execute merges
7. Monitor integration progress

### Context:
- Base Branch: phase1/wave1/integration (Wave 1 already integrated)
- Target Branch: phase1/wave2/integration (new)
- Efforts to Integrate:
  * cert-validation-split-001 (207 lines)
  * cert-validation-split-002 (800 lines) 
  * cert-validation-split-003 (800 lines)
  * fallback-strategies (560 lines)
- Total: ~2367 lines

### Critical Notes:
- Wave 1 is COMPLETE - do not re-integrate
- Wave 2 efforts are all reviewed and ready
- Use phase1/wave1/integration as the base (NOT main)
