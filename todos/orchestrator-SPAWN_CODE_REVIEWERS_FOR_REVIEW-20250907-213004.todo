## Next Actions (After Continuation)
- Spawn SW Engineer to subdivide Split-001 into 2-3 sub-splits
- Each sub-split must be <800 lines
- Monitor fix implementation
- Re-review after subdivision complete

## Context
- E1.2.1 final review completed but FAILED
- Split-001 has 1564 lines (nearly double the 800-line limit)
- Split-002 and Split-003 are compliant (460 and 536 lines)
- All other issues have been fixed (TODO comments, functions, tests)
- Integration BLOCKED until Split-001 is subdivided
