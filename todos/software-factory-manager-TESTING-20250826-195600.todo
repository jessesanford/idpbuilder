# SOFTWARE FACTORY MANAGER TODOs - Testing Compaction Recovery
# Generated: 2025-08-26 19:56:00 UTC
# Agent: software-factory-manager
# State: TESTING (Testing compaction recovery system)
# Context: Testing transcript-based identification for multi-agent workflows

## COMPLETED (4 items)
âœ“ Review and migrate rules from CRITICAL folder to rule-library
  - Moved all rules from ðŸš¨-CRITICAL to rule-library
  - Created proper rule files with enforcement details
  - Updated all references across the codebase

âœ“ Create R021 supreme law to prevent orchestrator stopping
  - Created as SUPREME LAW with -100% penalty
  - Enhanced with context recovery confidence
  - Added to multiple visibility points

âœ“ Fix line counter usage in sparse clones (R198 and R022)
  - Updated R198 for SW Engineer sparse clone scenario
  - Created R022 for Architect-specific guidance
  - Emphasized NO PARAMETERS requirement

âœ“ Implement transcript-based agent identification
  - Created transcript-based-precompact.sh
  - Created transcript-based-pretooluse.sh
  - Tested with multiple agent scenarios
  - Proven precise blocking works

## IN PROGRESS (1 item)
â†’ Test compaction recovery with multi-agent scenarios
  - Hook scripts deployed and configured
  - Settings.json updated with new scripts
  - Creating test TODOs for recovery testing
  - Next: Trigger actual compaction to test

## PENDING (3 items)
â—‹ Document transcript-based recovery system
  - Create comprehensive documentation
  - Include usage examples
  - Add troubleshooting guide

â—‹ Create integration tests for hook system
  - Test automatic compaction detection
  - Test manual compaction handling
  - Verify multi-agent isolation

â—‹ Update all agent configs with new rules
  - Add R021 to all agent configs
  - Update R198 and R022 references
  - Ensure rule visibility at key points

## RECOVERY CONTEXT
This TODO file is designed to test the compaction recovery system.
When compaction occurs:
1. PreCompact hook should detect this file as the latest TODO
2. Copy it to /tmp/todos-precompact-{TRANSCRIPT_ID}.txt
3. Create marker with TODO_STATE_SAVED pointing to the copy
4. On recovery, agent reads this file and loads TODOs

## KEY ACHIEVEMENTS
- Successfully migrated from ðŸš¨-CRITICAL to rule-library structure
- Created R021 as SUPREME LAW preventing orchestrator from stopping
- Fixed line counter confusion for both SW Engineers and Architects
- Implemented precise agent identification using transcript IDs
- Enabled true multi-agent workflows with isolated recovery

## NEXT IMMEDIATE ACTIONS
1. Trigger compaction with /compact command
2. Verify TODO state is preserved
3. Test recovery process
4. Confirm only this agent is blocked
5. Validate other agents continue normally
