## Completed Tasks
- [x] Reset state to SPAWN_CODE_REVIEWER_MERGE_PLAN
- [x] Spawned Code Reviewer to update merge plan
- [x] Merge plan updated to reflect split-002 rebase
- [x] Integration complexity reduced from COMPLEX to SIMPLE

## Key Updates to Merge Plan
- Split-002 now properly based on current split-001
- Linear history achieved: phase1/integration → split-001 → split-002
- Merge sequence simplified (no complex conflicts expected)
- Risk level reduced to LOW

## Next Actions (after continuation)
- Transition to WAITING_FOR_MERGE_PLAN
- Then spawn Integration Agent to execute merges
- Monitor integration progress (should be smooth)
- Complete Phase 2 Wave 1 integration
