# Agent: code-reviewer

## In Progress (0)
[None]

## Pending (0)
[None]

## Completed (7)
1. Read the Architect's Phase 1 architecture file
   - Successfully read phase-1-architecture.md from architect
   - Extracted wave structure and effort breakdown

2. Read master implementation plan for context
   - Read IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN.md for overall context

3. Check if phase-tests/phase-1/ exists
   - Confirmed phase tests exist in phase-tests/phase-1/

4. Read target-repo-config.yaml
   - Read repository configuration for branch naming conventions

5. Create PHASE-1-IMPLEMENTATION.md
   - Created detailed implementation plan based on architect's design
   - Included 5 efforts across 2 waves
   - Each effort has explicit scope control per R311
   - Total size: ~800 lines

6. Create phase-1-waves.json
   - Created machine-readable wave structure
   - Included parallelization metadata
   - Specified dependencies and constraints

7. Save and commit TODOs per R287
   - Saving current state for persistence

## Summary
Successfully translated the Architect's Phase 1 Architecture into actionable implementation plans. Created both PHASE-1-IMPLEMENTATION.md with detailed effort breakdowns and phase-1-waves.json with machine-readable metadata. All efforts follow strict TDD methodology with tests written FIRST. The plan maintains the 800-line limit and provides explicit scope control for each effort.
