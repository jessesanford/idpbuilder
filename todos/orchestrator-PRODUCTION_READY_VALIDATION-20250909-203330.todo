# Orchestrator TODO State
State: PRODUCTION_READY_VALIDATION
Timestamp: 2025-09-09 20:33 UTC
Agent: orchestrator

## Completed
- ✅ Read state-specific rules for FIX_BUILD_ISSUES state
- ✅ Check for master implementation plan
- ✅ Analyze current build failures and issues
- ✅ Clean reset to PRODUCTION_READY_VALIDATION state

## Next Actions for PRODUCTION_READY_VALIDATION
- [ ] Run comprehensive validation (R271)
- [ ] Build validation: make build or go build ./...
- [ ] Test execution: go test ./... with coverage
- [ ] Security scanning if applicable
- [ ] Binary artifact creation
- [ ] Determine transition based on results:
  - If ALL tests pass → transition to PROJECT_COMPLETE
  - If test failures → transition to ANALYZE_BUILD_FAILURES (NOT FIX_BUILD_ISSUES)
  - If build failures → transition to ANALYZE_BUILD_FAILURES

## Context
- Project integration branch HAS the import path fixes
- Code SHOULD build successfully
- Some test failures might be pre-existing (not from our changes)
- Focus on whether OUR changes work correctly
