# Orchestrator TODO State
# State: SPAWN_CODE_REVIEWERS_EFFORT_PLANNING
# Time: 2025-09-15T18:28:00Z
# Purpose: Planning E2.2.2-A credential-management

## Completed
- ✅ Setup effort infrastructure for E2.2.2-A
- ✅ Created workspace from cli-commands base
- ✅ Spawned Code Reviewer for planning
- ✅ Updated orchestrator state

## Next Steps (when continuing)
1. Transition to MONITOR_EFFORT_PLANNING
2. Check if planning is complete
3. When planning done, transition to SPAWN_SW_ENGINEERS_IMPLEMENTATION
4. Spawn Software Engineer to implement E2.2.2-A
5. Monitor implementation progress
6. After E2.2.2-A complete, setup E2.2.2-B

## Current Effort Status
- E2.2.2-A: Planning in progress (Code Reviewer active)
- E2.2.2-B: Pending (depends on E2.2.2-A)
- E2.2.1: Complete (cli-commands)

## Notes
- Code Reviewer has created IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN.md
- Next state should spawn SW Engineer for implementation
- Must complete E2.2.2-A before starting E2.2.2-B
