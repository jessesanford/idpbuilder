## Completed Tasks:
✅ Measured implementation size using line-counter.sh: 3646 lines
✅ Checked for stub implementations (R320): None found
✅ Verified code quality and patterns: Good structure
✅ Checked test coverage: 33 test files present
✅ Verified independence per R307: Builds independently
✅ Security review: Proper handling of security concerns
✅ Created timestamped CODE-REVIEW-REPORT-20250914-154703.md

- Implementation: 3646 lines (4.5x over 800-line limit)
- Requires splitting into 5-6 separate efforts
- Quality is good but size is a critical blocker
