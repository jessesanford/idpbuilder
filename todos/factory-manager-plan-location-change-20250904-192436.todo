# Software Factory Manager - Plan Location Change
Date: 2025-09-04
Status: COMPLETED

## Summary
Implemented comprehensive change to store all effort and split plans inside working copies in .software-factory/ subdirectories, rather than in the root directory.

## Changes Made:

### 1. Code Reviewer States
- ✅ EFFORT_PLAN_CREATION: Now saves to .software-factory/phaseX/waveY/effort-name/
- ✅ CREATE_SPLIT_PLAN: Now saves split plans in .software-factory/phaseX/waveY/effort-split-XXX/

### 2. SW Engineer States  
- ✅ INIT: Checks .software-factory/ first, fallback to legacy locations
- ✅ IMPLEMENTATION: Looks for plans in .software-factory/ with backward compatibility
- ✅ SPLIT_IMPLEMENTATION: Searches new location first, then old locations

### 3. Orchestrator States
- ✅ SETUP_EFFORT_INFRASTRUCTURE: Creates .software-factory/ directory structure

### 4. Documentation Updates
- ✅ R303: Updated to document new effort plan locations
- ✅ Templates: Added storage location comments to plan templates

## New Structure:
```
effort-directory/
├── .software-factory/
│   └── phaseX/
│       └── waveY/
│           ├── effort-name/
│           │   └── IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS.md
│           └── effort-name-split-XXX/
│               └── SPLIT-PLAN-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS.md
└── src/  (actual code)
```

## Backward Compatibility:
All changes include fallback logic to check old locations if plans not found in new .software-factory/ structure.

## Benefits:
1. Keeps plans organized within working copies
2. Clear hierarchy matching phase/wave/effort structure  
3. Prevents clutter in root directories
4. Timestamps prevent collisions (R301)
5. SW Engineers know exactly where to look
