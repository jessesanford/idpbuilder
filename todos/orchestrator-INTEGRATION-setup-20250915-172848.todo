# Saved: 2025-09-15 15:45 UTC

## Completed Tasks
✅ Analyzed Phase 2 Wave 2 cli-commands dependencies
✅ Determined cli-commands needed rebasing onto Wave 1 integration
✅ Spawned SW Engineer to perform git rebase
✅ Verified successful rebase with Wave 1 commits integrated
✅ Updated orchestrator-state.json for Wave 2 re-integration

## State File Updates
- Set current_state to INTEGRATION
- Updated to Phase 2, Wave 2
- Marked cli-commands as READY_FOR_INTEGRATION
- Updated base branch to idpbuilder-oci-build-push/phase2/wave1/integration-20250915-125755
- Documented old Wave 2 integration as obsolete

## Next Steps (when continued)
The INTEGRATION state will trigger:
1. SETUP_INTEGRATION_INFRASTRUCTURE - Create new workspace
2. SPAWN_CODE_REVIEWER_MERGE_PLAN - Plan the merge
3. WAITING_FOR_MERGE_PLAN - Review plan
4. SPAWN_INTEGRATION_AGENT - Execute integration
5. MONITORING_INTEGRATION - Monitor progress
6. WAVE_COMPLETE - If successful
