# Saved: 2025-09-15 21:50:45 UTC

## Completed Tasks
✅ Read E2.2.2-B (image-operations) implementation plan
✅ Inject effort metadata into E2.2.2-B plan (R213)
✅ Analyze SW Engineer parallelization for E2.2.2-B
✅ Update orchestrator-state.json with parallelization plan
✅ Transition to SPAWN_AGENTS state (R324)
✅ Save TODOs and commit state (R287/R288)

## Analysis Summary
- Analyzed implementation parallelization for Phase 2 Wave 2
- Single effort E2.2.2-B (image-operations) ready for implementation
- No parallelization possible - single SW Engineer spawn required
- Successfully transitioned to SPAWN_AGENTS state

## Next Steps (for SPAWN_AGENTS state)
- [ ] Spawn SW Engineer for E2.2.2-B implementation
- [ ] Monitor implementation progress
- [ ] Spawn Code Reviewer when implementation complete
