# Orchestrator TODOs - SPAWN_CODE_REVIEWER_REBASE_PLAN State
# Saved: 2025-09-13T20:11:00Z
# Reason: R322 checkpoint before spawning Code Reviewer for rebase merge plan

## Completed Tasks
✅ Analyze Phase 2 Wave 1 existing efforts and their current state
✅ Setup rebase infrastructure for Phase 2 Wave 1 efforts
✅ Create rebase plan document (PHASE-2-REBASE-PLAN.md)
✅ Update orchestrator-state.json for SPAWN_CODE_REVIEWER_REBASE_PLAN

## Pending Tasks
⏸️ Spawn Code Reviewer to create Phase 2 Wave 1 rebase merge plan
⏸️ Stop for R322 checkpoint

## Context
- Following R327 cascade pattern for rebases
- Phase 2 Wave 1 efforts need rebasing onto Phase 1 integration
- Code Reviewer will create merge plan first (not direct SW Engineer rebase)
- Efforts to rebase:
  * gitea-client
  * gitea-client-split-001
  * gitea-client-split-002

## Next Actions
1. Spawn Code Reviewer with task to create rebase merge plan
2. Wait for merge plan completion
3. Review merge plan
4. Then spawn Integration Agent to execute rebases
