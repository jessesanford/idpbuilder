# Saved: 2025-09-12 19:56:00 UTC

## Completed Tasks
âœ… Monitor Phase 1 integration agent completion
âœ… Check Phase 1 integration report for R291 gates  
âœ… Analyze integration test failures and determine next action
âœ… Update orchestrator state based on integration results
âœ… Transition to appropriate state and stop for continuation

## Next State Work (IMMEDIATE_BACKPORT_REQUIRED)
ðŸ“‹ Read R321-immediate-backport-during-integration.md for backport protocol
ðŸ“‹ Create backport plan for test failures
ðŸ“‹ Spawn Code Reviewer to create fix plans
ðŸ“‹ Distribute fixes to effort branches
ðŸ“‹ Monitor fix implementation
ðŸ“‹ Re-run phase integration after fixes

## Phase 1 Test Issues Requiring Backport
ðŸ”´ pkg/kind/cluster_test.go:232 - undefined: types.ContainerListOptions
ðŸ”´ pkg/cert* tests - setup failed

## R321 Enforcement
- Integration branches are READ-ONLY
- ALL fixes must go to source branches first
- Phase integration must be DELETED and RE-CREATED after fixes
- Re-merge ALL waves to get fixed code
