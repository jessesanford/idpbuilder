# Orchestrator TODO State - ERROR_RECOVERY
# Saved: 2025-09-11 22:57:15 UTC
# Trigger: State transition from MONITORING_INTEGRATION to ERROR_RECOVERY

## Completed Tasks:
✅ Perform agent identity verification and rule acknowledgment
✅ Check environment and verify repository configuration  
✅ Load orchestrator state from file
✅ Check for master implementation plan
✅ Load state-specific rules for MONITORING_INTEGRATION
✅ Monitor Integration Agent progress
✅ Check for integration report and enforce R291 gates
✅ Determine next state transition based on integration results
✅ Update state file to ERROR_RECOVERY due to R291 failures
✅ Save TODO state per R287

## In Progress:
- Commit and push state changes

## Pending in ERROR_RECOVERY:
- Analyze R291 gate failures
- Create fix plan for build failures
- Spawn Code Reviewer to create fix assignments
- Address split-001 file deletion issue
- Create demo scripts for all efforts
- Re-run integration after fixes

## Critical Issues Requiring Resolution:
1. Split-001 deleted critical project files (Makefile, main.go, etc.)
2. Build cannot complete due to missing dependencies
3. No demo scripts exist (R291 requirement)
4. Tests cannot run without successful build
