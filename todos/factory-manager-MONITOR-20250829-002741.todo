# Software Factory Manager - Code Review Gap Fix
Date: 2025-08-29 00:45:00 UTC
State: MONITOR Fix Implementation

## Completed Tasks:
✅ Analyzed the critical gap: Code Reviewers never spawned for implementation review
✅ Updated MONITOR state rules to detect implementation completion and spawn reviewers
✅ Updated R222 to clarify orchestrator responsibilities for spawning reviewers
✅ Added transition logic from MONITOR to spawn Code Reviewers
✅ Updated state machine to reflect the review spawning flow
✅ Created spawn command template for Code Reviewers

## Critical Changes Made:

### 1. MONITOR State Rules Enhanced
- Added mandatory section for spawning Code Reviewers when implementation completes
- Added detection logic for implementation_status: COMPLETE without review
- Added immediate spawn command template
- Updated state transitions to include SPAWN_CODE_REVIEWER flow

### 2. R222 Rule Enhanced
- Added ORCHESTRATOR RESPONSIBILITIES section
- Clarified that reviews don't happen automatically
- Specified when to spawn Code Reviewers
- Emphasized -100% grading penalty for not spawning reviewers

### 3. State Machine Updated
- Added explicit MONITOR → SPAWN_CODE_REVIEWER transition
- Clarified the full implementation-review-fix loop
- Updated mermaid diagram to show review spawning

## Impact:
This fixes a CRITICAL gap where code would be integrated without any review,
violating R222 and causing -100% grading failure.
