# Orchestrator TODOs - SPAWN_INTEGRATION_AGENT_PHASE → MONITORING_PHASE_INTEGRATION
# Saved: 2025-10-06T06:21:29Z
# Trigger: R322 checkpoint - state transition completed

## Completed Tasks ✅
- [x] Read and verify PHASE-MERGE-PLAN.md exists in phase integration directory
- [x] Verify phase integration infrastructure and branch status  
- [x] Verify all wave branches are complete and ready for integration
- [x] Spawn Integration Agent to execute phase merge plan
- [x] Update orchestrator-state.json to MONITORING_PHASE_INTEGRATION
- [x] Save TODOs and commit state changes per R287/R288

## Integration Agent Status
- Agent: software-engineer (integration mode)
- Working Directory: /home/vscode/workspaces/idpbuilder-push-oci/efforts/phase1/integration
- Task: Execute Phase 1 Integration Merge Plan
- Merge Plan: .software-factory/PHASE-MERGE-PLAN-CORRECTED--20251005-184300.md
- Status: COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY ✅

## Integration Results
- Wave 1 merged: ✅ SUCCESS
- Wave 2 merged: ✅ SUCCESS  
- Build validation: ✅ SUCCESS (no errors!)
- Integration report: /home/vscode/workspaces/idpbuilder-push-oci/efforts/phase1/integration/.software-factory/PHASE-1-INTEGRATION-REPORT--20251006-061800.md
- Final commit: edd0009 (pushed to target/idpbuilder-push-oci/phase1-integration)

## Next State Actions (MONITORING_PHASE_INTEGRATION)
- Read integration report to verify success/failure
- Update orchestrator state with integration results
- Transition to appropriate next state based on results:
  * If SUCCESS → PHASE_COMPLETE or project completion
  * If NEEDS_FIXES → IMMEDIATE_BACKPORT_REQUIRED per R321
  * If FAILED → ERROR_RECOVERY

## Notes
- Per R322: Stopped after spawning agent for context preservation
- Per R405: CONTINUE-SOFTWARE-FACTORY=TRUE (normal operation)
- Integration completed faster than expected - build validates successfully
