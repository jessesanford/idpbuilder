# SOFTWARE FACTORY MANAGER - SPLIT INFRASTRUCTURE CLARIFICATION
# Completed: $(date)

## COMPLETED TASKS:
✅ Check and update orchestrator MONITOR state for split infrastructure creation
✅ Add explicit split infrastructure creation to orchestrator when splits detected  
✅ Update R204 to emphasize orchestrator responsibility more clearly
✅ Create SPAWN_ENGINEERS_FOR_SPLITS state rules (handled in existing states)
✅ Update orchestrator.md with split infrastructure section
✅ Add split infrastructure verification script updates
✅ Update state machine for split infrastructure flow
✅ Commit and push all changes

## KEY CLARIFICATIONS MADE:

### 1. R204 - Orchestrator Split Infrastructure Rule
- Title updated: "ORCHESTRATOR (Not SW Engineer!) Must Create Complete Split Infrastructure"
- Added clear "WHO DOES WHAT" section
- Emphasized orchestrator responsibility throughout

### 2. MONITOR State Rules
- Added "ORCHESTRATOR CREATES SPLIT INFRASTRUCTURE (R204)" section
- Included complete function for creating split infrastructure
- Clarified flow: Code Reviewer plans → Orchestrator infrastructure → SW Engineer implements

### 3. Orchestrator.md Agent Config
- Added "Split Infrastructure Creation (R204)" as section 4
- Listed what orchestrator MUST and MUST NOT do
- Included split infrastructure checklist

### 4. State Machine
- Added "Split Infrastructure Flow" section before Phase 1
- Clear 8-step process with role assignments
- Explicit "WHO DOES WHAT" summary

### 5. Verification Script
- Added header comment clarifying orchestrator responsibility
- Already had proper checks for .git directories and structure

## IMPACT:
This clarification ensures that:
- Orchestrators know THEY create split infrastructure
- SW Engineers know to WAIT for infrastructure
- Code Reviewers only create documentation/plans
- No confusion about responsibilities per R204
