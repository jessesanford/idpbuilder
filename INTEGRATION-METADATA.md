# Phase 1 Integration Infrastructure Metadata

## Integration Details
- **Type**: Phase Integration
- **Phase**: 1
- **Total Waves**: 2
- **Branch**: idpbuilder-oci-build-push/phase1/integration
- **Base Branch**: idpbuilder-oci-build-push/phase1/wave2/integration
- **Created**: 2025-09-13T17:34:00Z
- **Created By**: orchestrator

## R308 Incremental Branching Compliance
- **Rule Applied**: Phase integration properly based on Wave 2 integration
- **Verification**: This integration builds on all Phase 1 waves (Wave 1 and Wave 2)
- **Incremental**: Building on Wave 2 which already includes Wave 1

## R327 Cascade Re-integration Context
- **Cascade Reason**: Backport fixes applied to effort branches after initial integration
- **Cascade Sequence**: Wave 1 → Wave 2 → Phase 1 (current)
- **Fresh Integrations Completed**:
  - Wave 1: Completed at 2025-09-13T13:45:10Z
  - Wave 2: Completed at 2025-09-13T14:54:38Z
  - Phase 1: Infrastructure ready (current step)

## Infrastructure Setup
- **Workspace**: /home/vscode/workspaces/idpbuilder-oci-build-push/efforts/phase1/phase-integration-workspace
- **Repository Clone**: Full checkout (R271 compliant)
- **Remote Tracking**: Established with force push
- **Previous Integration**: idpbuilder-oci-build-push/phase1/integration-20250912-215031 (deprecated per R327)

## Next Steps
1. **Spawn Code Reviewer** to create Phase 1 merge plan
2. **Spawn Integration Agent** to execute merges per plan
3. **Monitor integration progress**
4. **Spawn Code Reviewer** for integration validation
5. **Handle any integration issues** if they arise

## Compliance Status
- ✅ R308: Incremental branching strategy applied
- ✅ R250: Integration isolation in dedicated workspace
- ✅ R271: Full repository checkout (no sparse)
- ✅ R014: Branch naming convention followed
- ✅ R034: Integration requirements checklist ready
- ✅ R307: Independent mergeability will be verified
- ✅ R006: No code written by orchestrator
- ✅ R329: No merges performed by orchestrator

## Notes
This Phase 1 integration is part of the R327 mandatory cascade re-integration process.
Both Wave 1 and Wave 2 have been freshly integrated with all backport fixes applied.
This Phase 1 integration will combine the fresh Wave 1 and Wave 2 integrations.
