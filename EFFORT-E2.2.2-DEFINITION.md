# Effort E2.2.2: Image Persistence & Production Push

**Effort ID**: E2.2.2
**Name**: image-persistence-push
**Phase**: 2 (Build & Push Implementation)
**Wave**: 2 (CLI Integration)
**Type**: Follow-on Enhancement
**Predecessor**: E2.2.1 (CLI Commands - Base Implementation)

## Purpose

This effort completes the production implementation of the build and push commands by adding the missing image persistence layer and replacing all stub implementations with production-ready code.

## Relationship to E2.2.1

E2.2.1 successfully established:
- ✅ CLI command structure (build and push commands)
- ✅ Basic authentication framework
- ✅ Certificate handling integration
- ✅ Command-line interface and flags
- ✅ Registry client structure

E2.2.2 completes the implementation by adding:
- ✅ Local image storage system
- ✅ Real image persistence after build
- ✅ Real image loading for push
- ✅ Actual OCI manifest and layer transmission
- ✅ Real progress tracking
- ✅ Environment-based authentication

## Scope

### Core Deliverables
1. **Image Storage System** (`pkg/storage/`)
   - Local OCI layout storage
   - Image indexing by tag
   - Retrieval for push operations

2. **Build Command Enhancement**
   - Save built images to local store
   - Report storage location

3. **Push Command Production Implementation**
   - Load real images from storage
   - Send actual manifests and layers
   - Real progress tracking
   - Environment variable authentication

### R320 Compliance
- NO stub implementations
- NO placeholder code
- NO TODO comments in implementation
- ONLY production-ready code

## Success Criteria
- Build command saves images locally
- Push command retrieves and sends real images
- Successful push to Gitea registry verified
- All R320 violations resolved

## Size Estimate
~600 lines (within 800-line limit)
