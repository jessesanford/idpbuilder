## 📊 Risk Analysis

### Technical Risks
| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|------------|
| [RISK_1] | [H/M/L] | [H/M/L] | [STRATEGY] |
| [RISK_2] | [H/M/L] | [H/M/L] | [STRATEGY] |
| [RISK_3] | [H/M/L] | [H/M/L] | [STRATEGY] |

### Sequencing Risks
- **Wave 1 Incomplete**: Blocks Wave 2 start
- **Integration Issues**: May require additional wave
- **Review Rejections**: Could trigger effort splits

### Mitigation Strategies
1. **Proactive Splitting**: Split efforts approaching 700 lines
2. **Early Integration**: Test integration after each effort
3. **Parallel Reviews**: Start reviews before completion
4. **Buffer Time**: Include 20% schedule buffer
