## 7. TDD Workflow Requirements

### MANDATORY TDD CYCLE FOR EVERY EFFORT:
1. **RED PHASE**: Write failing tests FIRST
   - Define what success looks like
   - Write comprehensive test cases
   - Run tests - they MUST fail initially

2. **GREEN PHASE**: Write minimal code to pass
   - Implement ONLY enough to pass tests
   - No extra features or optimizations
   - All tests must pass

3. **REFACTOR PHASE**: Improve code quality
   - Clean up implementation
   - Optimize performance
   - Tests must still pass

### TEST COVERAGE REQUIREMENTS:
- **Unit Tests**: Minimum 80% code coverage
- **Integration Tests**: All component interactions
- **End-to-End Tests**: Critical user journeys
- **Performance Tests**: Load and stress testing
- **Security Tests**: Vulnerability scanning
