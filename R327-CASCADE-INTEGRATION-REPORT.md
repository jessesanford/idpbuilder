# R327 CASCADE Integration Report - Phase 1 Wave 2

**Integration Agent**: INTEGRATION
**Date**: 2025-09-14 12:05:23 UTC - 12:15:00 UTC
**Integration Branch**: idpbuilder-oci-build-push/phase1/wave2-integration
**Integration Directory**: /home/vscode/workspaces/idpbuilder-oci-build-push/efforts/phase1/wave2/integration-workspace/repo
**Task**: R327 CASCADE re-integration verification after R321 backport fixes

## Executive Summary

Successfully verified and validated the Phase 1 Wave 2 integration following the R327 cascade pattern. The integration was previously completed on 2025-09-13, and this verification confirms all components remain properly integrated after the R321 backport fixes and R327 cascade rebase operations.

## Context - R327 CASCADE Pattern

This integration is part of the R327 cascade pattern where:
1. Wave 1 was re-integrated with all R321 fixes
2. Wave 2 efforts were rebased onto the fresh Wave 1 integration
3. Wave 2 integration was recreated on top of the rebased efforts
4. This verification confirms the final state is correct

## Efforts Integrated (Previously Completed)

1. **E1.2.1-cert-validation (Split into 3 parts)**
   - cert-validation-split-001: Certificate types and interfaces ✅
   - cert-validation-split-002: Validation implementation ✅
   - cert-validation-split-003: Validation completion ✅
   - All R321 fixes preserved in source branches

2. **E1.2.2-fallback-strategies**
   - Fallback mechanism for registry operations ✅
   - 560 lines of code
   - R321 fixes preserved

## R327 CASCADE Compliance Verification

### Cascade Pattern Requirements

- ✅ Integration branch contains all fixes through cascade

### R321 Fix Verification
Confirmed R321 fixes present in integrated branch:
- ✅ cert-validation-split-001: commit 9d05978 (R321 backport analysis)
