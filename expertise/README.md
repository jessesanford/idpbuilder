# Software Factory 2.0 Expertise Modules

This directory contains comprehensive expertise modules that provide detailed patterns, best practices, and implementation guidance for building robust, scalable, and secure Kubernetes applications with KCP multi-tenancy support.

## üìã Module Overview

### üèóÔ∏è [KCP Patterns](kcp-patterns.md) [Rules R001-R065]
**Multi-tenant workspace isolation and KCP-specific patterns**

- **Core Architecture**: Workspace-aware controllers and logical cluster management
- **API Export/Binding**: Cross-workspace resource sharing patterns  
- **Multi-Tenancy**: Proper isolation and authorization mechanisms
- **Testing Strategies**: Workspace-isolated test environments
- **Performance**: Workspace-aware caching and scaling patterns
- **Anti-Patterns**: Common mistakes that break multi-tenancy

Key Focus: Ensuring proper workspace boundaries, logical cluster lifecycle management, and KCP's native cross-workspace communication patterns.

### ‚öôÔ∏è [Kubernetes Patterns](kubernetes-patterns.md) [Rules R066-R135] 
**Standard Kubernetes controller design and best practices**

- **Controller Architecture**: Reconciliation loops, status management, and event handling
- **Resource Lifecycle**: Owner references, finalizers, and proper cleanup
- **Error Handling**: Categorization, retry strategies, and exponential backoff
- **Testing**: EnvTest integration patterns and comprehensive test coverage
- **Performance**: Caching, concurrency limits, and efficient resource operations
- **RBAC**: Proper permission management and validation

Key Focus: Building robust, idempotent controllers that follow Kubernetes conventions and handle edge cases gracefully.

### üß™ [Testing Strategies](testing-strategies.md) [Rules R136-R190]
**Test-driven development and comprehensive validation approaches**

- **TDD Requirements**: 80% coverage minimum, tests-first development
- **Unit Testing**: Fast, isolated tests with proper mocking
- **Integration Testing**: EnvTest environments with realistic scenarios  
- **E2E Testing**: Complete workflow validation with real clusters
- **Test Data**: Realistic fixtures covering edge cases and error conditions
- **Performance**: Test execution time limits and stability requirements

Key Focus: Ensuring code quality through comprehensive testing strategies that validate functionality, performance, and reliability.

### üîí [Security Requirements](security-requirements.md) [Rules R191-R250]
**Security-first design and validation patterns**

- **RBAC & Authorization**: Least privilege principles and permission validation
- **Secret Management**: Secure credential handling and rotation support
- **Network Security**: TLS configuration and network policy patterns
- **Pod Security**: Non-root containers and restrictive security contexts
- **Admission Control**: Validating/mutating webhooks for policy enforcement
- **Vulnerability Management**: Image scanning and security validation

Key Focus: Implementing defense-in-depth security controls throughout the application stack.

### üöÄ [Performance Optimization](performance-optimization.md) [Rules R251-R310]
**High-performance, scalable system design patterns**

- **Controller Performance**: Efficient caching, batching, and event filtering
- **Memory Management**: Object pooling, leak prevention, and bounded usage
- **Caching Strategies**: Multi-level caching with proper invalidation
- **Concurrency**: Worker pools, rate limiting, and circuit breakers
- **Monitoring**: Metrics exposure, profiling, and distributed tracing
- **Resource Optimization**: CPU, memory, and connection pool tuning

Key Focus: Building systems that can handle production scale while maintaining responsiveness and reliability.

## üéØ Rule Reference System

Each expertise module uses a structured rule numbering system:

- **R001-R065**: KCP-specific patterns and multi-tenancy
- **R066-R135**: Kubernetes controller patterns and lifecycle
- **R136-R190**: Testing strategies and validation approaches  
- **R191-R250**: Security requirements and enforcement
- **R251-R310**: Performance optimization and scaling

### Rule Types

- **Rule R###**: Mandatory requirements that MUST be followed
- **Validation R###**: Quality gates and implementation criteria
- **Anti-Pattern R###**: Common mistakes that MUST be avoided

## üìä Pattern Detection

Each module includes automated detection queries for:

- **Pattern Compliance**: Bash/grep commands to find missing patterns
- **Anti-Pattern Detection**: Queries to identify problematic code
- **Quality Validation**: Automated checks for implementation standards

Example usage:
```bash
# Detect missing workspace context in controllers
grep -r "client.Client" --include="*.go" | grep -v "workspace" | head -10

# Find tests without proper assertions  
grep -r "func Test" --include="*_test.go" -A 20 | grep -L "assert\|require\|Expect"
```

## üèõÔ∏è Architecture Integration

These expertise modules are designed to work together:

1. **KCP Patterns** provide the multi-tenant foundation
2. **Kubernetes Patterns** ensure proper controller implementation  
3. **Testing Strategies** validate functionality and quality
4. **Security Requirements** enforce defense-in-depth protection
5. **Performance Optimization** ensure production readiness

## üöÄ Getting Started

### For Developers
1. Start with [KCP Patterns](kcp-patterns.md) for workspace awareness
2. Follow [Kubernetes Patterns](kubernetes-patterns.md) for controller design
3. Implement [Testing Strategies](testing-strategies.md) for quality assurance
4. Apply [Security Requirements](security-requirements.md) for protection
5. Use [Performance Optimization](performance-optimization.md) for scale

### For Code Reviewers
1. Validate against rule checklists in each module
2. Run pattern detection queries to find issues
3. Ensure validation criteria are met
4. Check for anti-patterns and security violations

### For Architects
1. Use modules to define system-wide standards
2. Customize rules based on specific requirements
3. Integrate with CI/CD pipelines for automated validation
4. Monitor compliance through metrics and tooling

## üìà Continuous Improvement

These modules are living documents that should be:

- **Updated** with new patterns as they emerge
- **Extended** with additional rules for specific use cases  
- **Validated** against real-world implementations
- **Automated** through tooling and CI/CD integration

## ü§ù Contributing

When adding new patterns or rules:

1. Follow the established numbering scheme
2. Include comprehensive code examples
3. Provide detection queries for automation
4. Add validation criteria and checklists
5. Document anti-patterns to avoid
