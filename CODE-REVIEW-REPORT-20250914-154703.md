🚨 HARD LIMIT VIOLATION: Branch exceeds 800 lines of IMPLEMENTATION code!
   This branch MUST be split immediately.
   Remember: Only implementation files count, NOT tests/demos/docs.

✅ Total implementation lines: 3646
```

## Size Analysis
- **Current Lines**: 3646 (implementation only)
- **Limit**: 800 lines
- **Status**: EXCEEDS (4.5x over limit)
- **Requires Split**: YES - MANDATORY

## Critical Finding: Size Limit Violation

🚨 **CRITICAL BLOCKER**: This implementation is 3646 lines, which is 4.5 times over the 800-line hard limit. This MUST be split into multiple smaller efforts before it can be approved.

### Recommended Split Strategy
Based on the package structure, this effort should be split into approximately 5-6 separate efforts:

1. **Split 001: Build Core** (~700 lines)
   - pkg/build/context.go
   - pkg/build/types.go
   - pkg/build/storage.go
   - pkg/build/feature_flags.go

2. **Split 002: Image Builder** (~700 lines)
   - pkg/build/image_builder.go
   - pkg/build/templates/

3. **Split 003: Certificate Core** (~700 lines)
   - pkg/certs/extractor.go
   - pkg/certs/errors.go
   - pkg/certs/helpers.go
   - pkg/certs/utilities.go

4. **Split 004: Certificate Validation** (~700 lines)
   - pkg/certs/chain_validator.go
   - pkg/certs/validation_errors.go
   - pkg/certvalidation/

5. **Split 005: Certificate Infrastructure** (~700 lines)
   - pkg/certs/kind_client.go
   - pkg/certs/storage.go
   - pkg/certs/trust.go
   - pkg/certs/diagnostics.go

6. **Split 006: Fallback Manager** (~146 lines remaining)
   - pkg/fallback/

## Functionality Review
- ✅ Core functionality appears complete
- ✅ No stub implementations detected (R320 compliant)
- ✅ No panic("unimplemented") found
- ✅ Context.TODO() usage is standard Go practice

## Code Quality
- ✅ Clean, well-structured code
- ✅ Proper package organization
- ✅ Appropriate error handling
- ✅ Clear separation of concerns

## Test Coverage
- ✅ Test files present: 33 test files found
- ✅ New packages have corresponding tests:
  - pkg/build/*_test.go files exist
  - pkg/certs/*_test.go files exist
  - pkg/certvalidation has tests
- ✅ Test structure follows Go conventions

## Pattern Compliance
- ✅ Go patterns followed correctly
- ✅ Package structure is clean
- ✅ Error handling follows Go idioms
- ✅ Interface definitions are appropriate

## Security Review
- ✅ Command execution properly contained in test mocks
- ✅ InsecureSkipVerify is feature-flagged appropriately
- ✅ TLS configuration is handled securely
- ✅ No hardcoded credentials found
- ✅ Proper error handling prevents information leakage

## Independence Verification (R307)
- ✅ Code compiles independently
- ✅ No breaking changes to existing functionality
- ✅ Proper feature flags for incomplete features
- ✅ Could merge independently once size is addressed

## Issues Found

### 🚨 CRITICAL (Blocking)
1. **Size Limit Violation**: 3646 lines far exceeds the 800-line limit
   - **Impact**: Cannot proceed without splitting
   - **Fix Required**: Must create split plan and implement in separate efforts

### ⚠️ MINOR (Non-blocking)
1. **TODO Comments**: Several TODO comments exist but they're legitimate future work items, not missing implementations
2. **Uncommitted Changes**: Two uncommitted files (sw-engineer-fix-command.md and a TODO file) - should be cleaned up

## Recommendations
1. **IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED**: Create a comprehensive split plan dividing this 3646-line implementation into 5-6 efforts of <800 lines each
2. Clean up uncommitted files in the repository
3. Each split should be independently compilable and testable
4. Maintain clear boundaries between splits to avoid duplication

## Next Steps
**SPLIT_REQUIRED**: This effort MUST be split into multiple smaller efforts before it can proceed. The implementation quality is good, but the size violation is a hard blocker that requires immediate attention.

1. Create SPLIT-INVENTORY.md with complete mapping
2. Create individual SPLIT-PLAN-XXX.md files for each split
3. Execute splits sequentially with proper dependency ordering
4. Each split must be <800 lines and independently reviewable

## Compliance Status
- ❌ R007 (Size Limit): VIOLATED - 3646 > 800 lines
- ✅ R307 (Independence): COMPLIANT - Builds independently
- ✅ R320 (No Stubs): COMPLIANT - No stub implementations
- ✅ R323 (Build): COMPLIANT - Builds successfully
