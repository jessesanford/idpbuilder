# Effort Path Fix Report

## Issue Identified
The orchestrator was using absolute paths `/efforts/**` which caused permission errors:
```
Error: mkdir: cannot create directory '/efforts': Permission denied
```

## Root Cause
The Software Factory was designed with the assumption that `/efforts` would be a globally accessible directory (as seen in Dockerfile and README setup instructions). However, in practice:
1. Users may not have permissions to create directories at system root
2. The system should be flexible to work within the project directory
3. The `target-repo-config.yaml` actually defines `efforts_root: "efforts"` as a relative path

## Solution Implemented

### Files Modified
1. **agent-states/orchestrator/SETUP_EFFORT_INFRASTRUCTURE/rules.md**
   - Changed: `EFFORT_DIR="/efforts/phase${PHASE}/wave${WAVE}/${EFFORT}"`
   - To: `EFFORT_DIR="${CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR}/efforts/phase${PHASE}/wave${WAVE}/${EFFORT}"`

2. **agent-states/orchestrator/INTEGRATION/rules.md**
   - Changed: `WAVE_DIR="/efforts/phase${X}/wave${Y}"`
   - To: `WAVE_DIR="${CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR}/efforts/phase${X}/wave${Y}"`

3. **agent-states/orchestrator/PHASE_INTEGRATION/rules.md**
   - Changed: `PHASE_DIR="/efforts/phase${PHASE}"`
   - To: `PHASE_DIR="${CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR}/efforts/phase${PHASE}"`
   - Also updated all `cd /efforts/...` commands to use `${CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR}`

4. **agent-states/orchestrator/MONITOR/rules.md**
   - Changed: `EFFORT_DIR="/efforts/phase${PHASE}/wave${WAVE}/${effort}"`
   - To: `EFFORT_DIR="${CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR}/efforts/phase${PHASE}/wave${WAVE}/${effort}"`

5. **agent-states/orchestrator/INTEGRATION/RULE-R250-INTEGRATION-ISOLATION.md**
   - Updated documentation to use `${CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR}/efforts/...` paths

6. **rule-library/R271-single-branch-full-checkout.md**
   - Changed: `EFFORT_DIR="/efforts/phase${PHASE}/wave${WAVE}/${EFFORT}"`
   - To: `EFFORT_DIR="${CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR}/efforts/phase${PHASE}/wave${WAVE}/${EFFORT}"`

7. **rule-library/R283-project-integration-protocol.md**
   - Updated integration examples to use `${CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR}/efforts/integration`

8. **rule-library/R297-architect-split-detection-protocol.md**
   - Changed: `EFFORT_DIR="/efforts/phase${phase}/wave${wave}/${effort_name}"`
   - To: `EFFORT_DIR="${CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR}/efforts/phase${phase}/wave${wave}/${effort_name}"`

## Impact
This change ensures:
1. **Flexibility**: Works in any directory structure without requiring system-level permissions
2. **Consistency**: Aligns with `target-repo-config.yaml` which defines `efforts_root` as relative
3. **Portability**: Can run in containers, CI/CD environments, or local development without special setup
4. **Backward Compatibility**: Still works if `/efforts` exists and is accessible

## Verification
After these changes, the orchestrator should be able to:
1. Create effort directories under `${CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR}/efforts/`
2. Set up phase and wave integration workspaces
3. Monitor effort progress
4. Perform integration without permission errors

## Recommendation
The system still supports the global `/efforts` directory if users want to set it up (as shown in README.md and Dockerfile), but now it's optional rather than mandatory. The relative path approach is more flexible and doesn't require sudo permissions.
