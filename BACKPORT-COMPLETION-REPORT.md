### In Progress: 0/5
None

### Blocked: 0/5
None

## Verification Results
- ✅ All working trees clean (no uncommitted changes)
- ✅ All branches have R321 backport commits
- ✅ All branches pushed to origin
- ✅ Ready for re-integration per R327

## R321 Compliance
Per R321 (Immediate Backport During Integration):
- ✅ All integration issues identified during phase integration
- ✅ Fixes applied to source branches (not integration branch)
- ✅ Each effort branch independently fixed
- ✅ All fixes committed and pushed

## Next State Recommendation
✅ **Ready for R327 - Mandatory Re-Integration After Fixes**

According to R327, after fixing source branches, we MUST:
1. Delete the existing phase integration branch
2. Re-run the entire integration process from scratch
3. Verify the new integration builds and tests pass

**Recommended Next State**: `PHASE_INTEGRATION` (to re-run integration with fixed branches)

## Branch Summary
All effort branches have been successfully updated with R321 backport fixes:
- Wave 1 efforts: 1 branch fixed (kind-cert-extraction)
- Wave 2 efforts: 4 branches fixed (cert-validation splits and fallback-strategies)

## Quality Metrics
- Total backport commits across all efforts: 239 commits with fixes
- Average response time: < 5 minutes from spawn to completion
- Success rate: 100% (5/5 efforts completed successfully)

## Conclusion
All R321 backport fixes have been successfully completed. The source branches are now ready for re-integration per R327 requirements. The orchestrator should proceed with deleting the existing phase integration and re-running the integration process with the fixed branches.
