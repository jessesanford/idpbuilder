# Phase 2 Wave 2 Merge Plan - COMPLETE

**Status**: ‚úÖ READY FOR INTEGRATION
**Created By**: Code Reviewer Agent
**Timestamp**: 2025-09-16 00:45:00 UTC

## Deliverables Created

1. **Main Merge Plan**: `/home/vscode/workspaces/idpbuilder-oci-build-push/PHASE-2-WAVE-2-MERGE-PLAN.md`
   - Comprehensive 344-line plan
   - Explicit API compatibility requirements
   - Detailed conflict resolution rules
   - Step-by-step merge sequence

2. **Verification Script**: `/home/vscode/workspaces/idpbuilder-oci-build-push/verify-api-compatibility.sh`
   - Automated API compatibility checker
   - Executable and ready to use
   - Returns exit code 0 on success, 1 on failure

## Key Features of the Plan

### üî¥ Prevents Previous Failures
The plan explicitly addresses the root cause of previous integration failures:
- **Clear API requirements** documented
- **Forbidden API calls** explicitly listed
- **Conflict resolution rules** that prevent accepting old code

### ‚úÖ Correct Merge Order
Based on dependency analysis:
1. **cli-commands** first (establishes CLI structure)
2. **credential-management** second (adds auth layer)
3. **image-operations** third (completes functionality)

### üîç Verification at Every Step
- Post-merge verification commands after EACH merge
- Compilation checks
- API compatibility verification
- Test execution

### üö® Emergency Recovery
- Clear instructions for resetting if things go wrong
- Exact commands to return to clean state

## Instructions for Integration Agent

The Integration Agent should:
1. Read the full merge plan at `PHASE-2-WAVE-2-MERGE-PLAN.md`
2. Follow the plan EXACTLY - no deviations
3. Use the verification script after each merge
4. Stop immediately if any verification fails

## Critical Success Factors

The integration will succeed if:
- ‚úÖ Integration Agent follows the plan exactly
- ‚úÖ NO old API calls are accepted during conflicts
- ‚úÖ Verification script passes after each merge
- ‚úÖ All tests pass at the end

## Ready for Handoff

The merge plan is complete and ready for the Integration Agent to execute. Return control to the orchestrator to spawn the Integration Agent with this plan.
