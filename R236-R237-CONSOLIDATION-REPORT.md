## Changes Made

### Pattern 1: Duplicate R290 References
**Before:**
```markdown
3. Read: $CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/rule-library/R290-state-state-rule-reading-supreme-law.md
4. Read: $CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/rule-library/R290-state-rule-verification-enforcement.md
```

**After:**
```markdown
3. Read: $CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/rule-library/R290-state-rule-reading-verification-supreme-law.md
```

### Pattern 2: Example Updates
**Before:**
```markdown
❌ WRONG: "I acknowledge R234, R208, R236..."
```

**After:**
```markdown
❌ WRONG: "I acknowledge R234, R208, R290..."
```

### Pattern 3: Acknowledgment Checklists
**Before:**
```markdown
□ I have read R236 - Mandatory State Rule Reading (SUPREME LAW #3)
□ I have read R237 - State Rule Verification Markers
```

**After:**
```markdown
□ I have read R290 - State Rule Reading and Verification (SUPREME LAW #3)
```

## Verification

### Grep Results
```bash
# Verified no remaining references to R236/R237 outside of:
# - DEPRECATED files
# - RULE-REGISTRY.md (tracking deprecation)
# - R290 itself (noting consolidation)
# - R283 (correctly updated reference)
```

### Token Savings
- **Before**: ~25 references to R236, ~49 references to R237 = 74 total references
- **After**: All consolidated to single R290 reference
- **Estimated savings**: ~500 tokens per agent startup (no duplicate rule reading)

## Status
✅ **COMPLETE** - All references successfully updated from R236/R237 to R290

## Next Steps
1. Monitor agent startups to ensure proper R290 compliance
2. Consider further consolidations in the future
3. Update training materials to reference R290 instead of R236/R237
