# Rule R204: ORCHESTRATOR Must Create Split Infrastructure Just-In-Time (Sequential)

## Rule Statement
**THE ORCHESTRATOR** (not SW Engineers, not Code Reviewers) MUST create split infrastructure JUST-IN-TIME, one split at a time. When split plans are detected, create infrastructure for split-001 ONLY. After split-001 completes, create split-002 infrastructure based on split-001. Continue this pattern sequentially. Each split MUST have its own directory with `-SPLIT-00Z` suffix and a SEPARATE clone of the target repository. Split branches MUST include the project prefix from target-repo-config.yaml using the branch-naming-helpers.sh functions. Splits MUST follow SEQUENTIAL branching: split-001 based on same base as original (per R308), split-002 based on split-001, split-003 based on split-002, etc. This ensures correct line counting and prevents cumulative measurement errors.

## 🔴🔴🔴 CRITICAL CLARIFICATION: WHO DOES WHAT 🔴🔴🔴
- **CODE REVIEWER**: Creates split PLANS (SPLIT-INVENTORY.md, SPLIT-PLAN-XXX.md)
- **ORCHESTRATOR**: Creates split INFRASTRUCTURE (directories, clones, branches)
- **SW ENGINEER**: IMPLEMENTS in pre-created infrastructure

## 🔴🔴🔴 PREREQUISITE: Code Reviewer Must Create Split Plans First 🔴🔴🔴
Before the orchestrator can create split infrastructure:
1. Code Reviewer must have created SPLIT-INVENTORY.md in too-large branch
2. Code Reviewer must have created all SPLIT-PLAN-XXX.md files
3. These files must be committed and pushed to the too-large branch remote
4. Orchestrator will fetch these plans from the too-large branch

## 🔴🔴🔴 CRITICAL: Project Prefix Required 🔴🔴🔴
**ALL split branches MUST include the project prefix!**
- Use `get_split_branch_name()` from branch-naming-helpers.sh
- Example: `tmc-workspace/phase1/wave1/api-types--split-001`
- NOT: `phase1/wave1/api-types--split-001` (missing prefix)

## Criticality Level
**BLOCKING** - Improper split setup causes merge conflicts and integration failures

## Enforcement Mechanism
- **Technical**: Orchestrator creates all infrastructure before agent spawn
- **Behavioral**: SW engineers refuse work if infrastructure missing
- **Grading**: -45% for improper split setup (Major architectural failure)

## Core Principle

```
Split Infrastructure = Complete Setup BEFORE Implementation
Orchestrator creates ALL directories, branches, and tracking FIRST
SW Engineers receive ready-to-use split workspaces
Merge strategy planned from the beginning
```

## 🔴🔴🔴 MANDATORY: Just-In-Time Sequential Creation 🔴🔴🔴

**SPLITS MUST BE CREATED ONE AT A TIME, JUST-IN-TIME!**

### Correct Just-In-Time Strategy:
1. **Split-001**: Create infrastructure when split plans detected
   - Base: Same as original effort (per R308 incremental base)
   - Spawn SW Engineer for implementation
2. **Wait for split-001 completion**
3. **Split-002**: Create infrastructure ONLY after split-001 done
   - Base: split-001 branch (now has committed code)
   - Spawn SW Engineer for implementation
4. **Wait for split-002 completion**
5. **Split-003**: Create infrastructure ONLY after split-002 done
   - Base: split-002 branch (includes split-001 + split-002 code)
   - Continue pattern for all splits

### Why This is MANDATORY:
1. **Line Counting Accuracy**: Each split shows correct line count
2. **No Cumulative Measurement**: Split-002 won't include split-001's lines
3. **Clean Integration**: Splits merge without conflicts
4. **Dependency Chain**: Later splits can use earlier split code

### FORBIDDEN Parallel Strategy:
```bash
# ❌❌❌ NEVER DO THIS - ALL SPLITS FROM SAME BASE
git checkout phase-integration
git checkout -b split-001  # OK: 400 lines
git checkout phase-integration  # WRONG!
git checkout -b split-002  # ERROR: Shows 800 lines (includes split-001!)
git checkout phase-integration  # WRONG!
git checkout -b split-003  # ERROR: Shows 1200 lines (includes all!)
```

The SPLIT-INVENTORY.md remains only in the too-large branch as documentation.

### Branch Structure for Clean Merging

### Merge Strategy Documentation

```yaml

merge_strategy:
  original_branch: "tmc-workspace/phase1/wave1/api-types"
  base_branch: "main"
  split_count: 3
  project_prefix: "tmc-workspace"
  
  splits:
    - number: "001"
      branch: "tmc-workspace/phase1/wave1/api-types--split-001"
      based_on: "main"
      merge_to: "main"
      
    - number: "002"
      branch: "tmc-workspace/phase1/wave1/api-types--split-002"
      based_on: "tmc-workspace/phase1/wave1/api-types--split-001"

    4: "Merge split-001 → main"
    5: "Abandon original too-large branch"
```

### Common Violations to Avoid

### ❌ Spawning Before Infrastructure
```bash
# WRONG - No infrastructure created
Task: software-engineer
Implement split-001
# Agent has nowhere to work!
```

### ❌ Creating Splits in Wrong Location
```bash
# WRONG - Not alongside original
efforts/splits/api-types-001/  # Wrong location!
# Should be: efforts/phase1/wave1/api-types--split-001/
```

### ❌ Wrong Base Branch Examples
```bash
# WRONG WAY #1 - Basing split-001 on oversized branch
git checkout -b split-001 effort-foo  # ❌ Inherits all 1200+ lines!
git checkout -b split-002 split-001    # Now has 1200+ lines too
git checkout -b split-003 split-002    # Cascading problem

# WRONG WAY #2 - All splits from same base
git checkout -b split-001 phase1/wave1-integration
git checkout -b split-002 phase1/wave1-integration  # ❌ Missing split-001!
git checkout -b split-003 phase1/wave1-integration  # ❌ Missing split-001 & 002!
```

### ✅ Correct Sequential Setup
```bash
# RIGHT - First split from SAME base as oversized effort
# Assume effort-foo was based on phase1/wave1-integration
git checkout -b split-001 phase1/wave1-integration  # Same base as effort-foo
git checkout -b split-002 split-001  # Based on previous split
git checkout -b split-003 split-002  # Based on previous split
```

## Integration with Other Rules

- **R199**: Single reviewer plans all splits
- **R202**: Single SW engineer implements all splits
- **R204**: Orchestrator creates infrastructure (THIS RULE)
- **R196**: Base branch selection from config
- **R193**: Effort clone protocol
- **R296**: Deprecated branch marking after splits complete

## Grading Impact

- **No infrastructure before spawn**: -45% (Major failure)
- **Wrong directory structure**: -30% (Organization failure)
- **No remote tracking**: -25% (Integration failure)
- **Wrong base branches**: -35% (Merge failure)
- **No merge strategy planning**: -20% (Planning failure)

## Summary

**Remember**:
- Orchestrator creates ALL split infrastructure FIRST
- Directories alongside too-large branch with clear naming
- Sequential base branches for clean merging
- Remote tracking for all split branches
- SW engineers verify before starting
- Merge strategy planned from the beginning
