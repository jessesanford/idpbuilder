# üö®üö®üö® RULE R258 - Mandatory Wave Review Report [BLOCKING]

## Rule Statement
**ARCHITECT MUST CREATE A PERMANENT WAVE REVIEW REPORT FILE BEFORE WAVE REVIEW COMPLETION**

The architect CANNOT signal wave review complete without:
1. Creating a standardized wave review report file
2. In the specified location with the exact naming convention
3. With all mandatory sections filled out
4. Verified by orchestrator before proceeding to next wave or phase assessment

## Why This Rule Exists

Previously, architects could provide wave review decisions through agent responses without creating any permanent record. This violated core principles:
- **No Audit Trail**: Wave decisions were not permanently documented
- **No Accountability**: No signed record of who approved what and when
- **No Verification**: Orchestrator couldn't verify review actually occurred
- **Lost Context**: Review details lost after conversation ended
- **No Metrics**: Integration quality and compliance data not preserved
- **No Decision Record**: Next steps unclear without documented decision

## Enforcement Mechanism

### üö® MANDATORY FILE REQUIREMENTS

**File Name**: `PHASE-{N}-WAVE-{W}-REVIEW-REPORT.md`
- Example: `PHASE-3-WAVE-2-REVIEW-REPORT.md`
- Example: `PHASE-1-WAVE-3-REVIEW-REPORT.md`

**Location**: `wave-reviews/phase{N}/wave{W}/`
- Full path: `wave-reviews/phase3/wave2/PHASE-3-WAVE-2-REVIEW-REPORT.md`
- Directory must be created if it doesn't exist

**Creation Timing**: BEFORE signaling wave review complete
- Report MUST exist before architect returns decision
- Orchestrator MUST verify file exists and is valid
- No state transition without verified report

### üìã MANDATORY REPORT STRUCTURE

```markdown
# Phase {N} Wave {W} Review Report

## Review Metadata
**Report ID**: WAVE-{N}-{W}-REVIEW-{YYYYMMDD}-{HHMMSS}
**Review Date**: {ISO-8601 timestamp}
**Reviewed By**: architect-reviewer
**Wave Branch**: {integration branch name}
**Efforts Reviewed**: {number of efforts in wave}

## Review Decision
**DECISION**: [PROCEED_NEXT_WAVE|PROCEED_PHASE_ASSESSMENT|CHANGES_REQUIRED|WAVE_FAILED]
**Confidence Level**: [HIGH|MEDIUM|LOW]
**Risk Assessment**: [LOW|MEDIUM|HIGH|CRITICAL]

## Integration Assessment
| Criterion | Status | Details |
|-----------|--------|---------|
| Branch Merges | [CLEAN|CONFLICTS_RESOLVED|ISSUES] | {details} |
| All Efforts Integrated | [YES|NO] | {count integrated}/{total} |
| Size Compliance | [ALL_UNDER_800|VIOLATIONS] | {violating efforts if any} |
| Test Results | [PASSING|FAILURES] | {pass rate %} |
| Build Status | [SUCCESS|FAILURE] | {details} |

## Architectural Review Scoring
| Category | Weight | Score (0-100) | Weighted Score |
|----------|--------|---------------|----------------|
| Pattern Compliance | 25% | {score} | {calculated} |
| API Consistency | 25% | {score} | {calculated} |
| Integration Quality | 20% | {score} | {calculated} |
| Code Quality | 15% | {score} | {calculated} |
| Test Coverage | 10% | {score} | {calculated} |
| Documentation | 5% | {score} | {calculated} |
| **OVERALL SCORE** | 100% | - | **{FINAL}** |

## Size Compliance Verification (Per R297 and R076)
| Effort | Split Count | Measured Size | Status | Notes |
|--------|-------------|---------------|--------|-------|
| {effort-name} | {0 or N} | {lines or "N/A"} | [PASS|FAIL] | {if split: "Already split - compliant"} |
| {effort-name} | {0 or N} | {lines or "N/A"} | [PASS|FAIL] | {if split: "Already split - compliant"} |

**Split Detection (R297)**: Checked split_count in orchestrator-state.json FIRST
**Measurement Method**: `$PROJECT_ROOT/tools/line-counter.sh` (from ORIGINAL effort directory)
**Measurement Target**: Original effort branches (NOT integration branches)
**All Efforts Compliant**: [YES|NO]

    # Generate report with all mandatory sections
    cat > "$REPORT_FILE" << 'EOF'
# Phase ${PHASE} Wave ${WAVE} Review Report

## Decision Types Explained

### PROCEED_NEXT_WAVE
- Wave fully approved with no blocking issues
- All efforts integrated successfully
- Ready to begin next wave of implementation
- Orchestrator should increment wave counter and start planning

### PROCEED_PHASE_ASSESSMENT
- Current wave was the last wave in phase
- All waves in phase have been integrated
- Ready for comprehensive phase assessment
- Orchestrator should trigger phase assessment protocol (R256, R257)

### CHANGES_REQUIRED
- Wave has fixable issues that must be addressed
- Specific actions identified in report
- Must fix before proceeding to next wave
- Orchestrator should coordinate fixes with appropriate agents

### WAVE_FAILED
- Wave has fundamental architectural problems
- Cannot proceed without major redesign
- Requires return to planning/design phase
- Orchestrator should initiate recovery protocol

## Validation Rules

### Report Validation Criteria
1. **File exists** at exact expected path
2. **All mandatory sections** present (not empty)
3. **Valid DECISION** value from allowed set
4. **Scores provided** for all architectural categories
5. **Size compliance** section completed with measurements
6. **Deliverables checklist** evaluated
7. **Sign-off section** completed with timestamp
8. **Report hash** present for integrity

### Orchestrator Validation Steps
```bash
# Comprehensive validation function
validate_wave_review_report() {
    local REPORT="$1"
    
    # Check mandatory sections exist
    local REQUIRED_SECTIONS=(
        "Review Decision"
        "Integration Assessment"
        "Architectural Review Scoring"
        "Size Compliance Verification"
        "Wave Deliverables Checklist"
        "Sign-Off"
    )
    
    for section in "${REQUIRED_SECTIONS[@]}"; do
        grep -q "^## $section" "$REPORT" || {
            echo "‚ùå Missing mandatory section: $section"
            return 1
        }
    done
    
    # Verify decision is valid
    grep -q "^\*\*DECISION\*\*: \(PROCEED_NEXT_WAVE\|PROCEED_PHASE_ASSESSMENT\|CHANGES_REQUIRED\|WAVE_FAILED\)" "$REPORT" || {
        echo "‚ùå Invalid or missing DECISION"
        return 1
    }
    
    # Verify size compliance is documented
    grep -q "^\*\*All Efforts Compliant\*\*: \(YES\|NO\)" "$REPORT" || {
        echo "‚ùå Missing size compliance status"
        return 1
    }
    
    # Verify sign-off exists
    grep -q "^\*\*Architect Sign-Off\*\*:" "$REPORT" || {
        echo "‚ùå Missing architect sign-off"
        return 1
    }
    
    # Verify report hash exists
    grep -q "^\*\*Report Hash\*\*:" "$REPORT" || {
        echo "‚ùå Missing report hash for integrity"
        return 1
    }
    
    echo "‚úÖ Wave review report validation passed"
    return 0
}
```

## State Machine Integration

### State Transitions Based on Report
```yaml
WAVE_REVIEW:
  transitions:
    - trigger: report_decision_PROCEED_NEXT_WAVE
      target: WAVE_START
      action: increment_wave_counter
    
    - trigger: report_decision_PROCEED_PHASE_ASSESSMENT
      target: SPAWN_ARCHITECT_PHASE_ASSESSMENT
      action: prepare_phase_assessment
    
    - trigger: report_decision_CHANGES_REQUIRED
      target: PROCESS_WAVE_FIXES
      action: extract_required_fixes
    
    - trigger: report_decision_WAVE_FAILED
      target: WAVE_RECOVERY
      action: initiate_recovery_protocol
```

## Violations

**Severity**: BLOCKING - Wave cannot complete without report

**Detection**:
- Architect signals wave review complete without creating report file
- Report file missing mandatory sections
- Invalid decision value in report
- Orchestrator proceeding without verifying report
- Report not committed to git repository
- Size compliance section incomplete or missing

**Consequences**:
- Immediate transition to ERROR_RECOVERY state
- Wave marked incomplete
- Cannot proceed to next wave or phase
- Architect must create proper report
- Orchestrator blocked from state progression
- Grading: -50 points (critical violation)

## Summary

**The Wave Review Report is MANDATORY and BLOCKING**:
- Every wave review MUST produce a permanent report file
- The report MUST follow the exact structure and naming convention
- The report MUST contain one of four valid decisions
- Orchestrator MUST verify the report before any state transition
- Decision field determines the next state in the state machine
- No verbal reviews allowed - everything must be documented
- Creates permanent audit trail for all wave-level decisions

This ensures accountability, traceability, and verifiability of all wave review decisions. NO WAVE CAN PROCEED WITHOUT A PROPER REVIEW REPORT.
