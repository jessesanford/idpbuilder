# üî¥üî¥üî¥ SUPREME LAW RULE R233 - All States Require Immediate Action

**Criticality:** SUPREME LAW - Violation = AUTOMATIC FAILURE  
**Enforcement:** MANDATORY - ALL AGENTS - ALL STATES
**Created:** 2025-01-27

## üö® STATES ARE VERBS - NOT DESTINATIONS! üö®

### THE FUNDAMENTAL LAW
Every state name is a VERB or ACTION. When you enter a state, you MUST immediately perform that action. States are not places to rest - they are commands to execute.

### FORBIDDEN PATTERNS (AUTOMATIC FAILURE)
```
‚ùå "STATE TRANSITION COMPLETE: Now in [STATE_NAME]" [stops]
‚ùå "Successfully transitioned to [STATE_NAME]" [waits]  
‚ùå "Ready to [action]" [pauses]
‚ùå "Entering [STATE_NAME] state" [does nothing]
‚ùå "I'm now in [STATE_NAME]" [waits for instruction]
```

### REQUIRED PATTERNS (ONLY ACCEPTABLE)
```
‚úÖ "Entering [STATE_NAME], immediately [doing specific action]..."
‚úÖ "[Verb form of state], starting with [first task]..."
‚úÖ "In [STATE_NAME], I'm NOW [actively doing the thing]..."
```

```

### HARD_STOP (TERMINAL STATE)  
**TERMINAL:** This is a terminal state - stopping is required
```bash
# FINAL ACTION:
echo "HARD_STOP - Critical failure detected"
exit 1
```

## ENFORCEMENT PROTOCOL

### For Non-Terminal States:
1. The INSTANT you enter the state, start the action
2. No announcements about being "in" the state
3. No "preparing to" or "ready to" statements
4. Just DO THE THING the state name says

### For Waiting States:
- "Waiting" doesn't mean passive - it means ACTIVELY CHECKING
- Poll status every few seconds
- Report what you're checking
- Set timeouts and handle them

### For Spawning States:
- Spawn IMMEDIATELY with the request
- Don't announce you're "going to spawn"
- Just spawn and report the result

### For Terminal States Only:
- SUCCESS and HARD_STOP are the ONLY states where stopping is allowed
- These must complete final actions then may terminate

## VIOLATION CONSEQUENCES

**ANY VIOLATION OF THIS RULE:**
- Immediate grading failure (-100%)
- Agent must be restarted
- Work invalidated
- User loses confidence

## EXAMPLES OF COMPLIANCE

### ‚úÖ CORRECT - INIT State:
```
Entering INIT, loading orchestrator state...
[reads file]
Current phase: 3, Current wave: 2
Checking environment... pwd: /workspaces/project
```

### ‚ùå WRONG - INIT State:
```
State transition complete. Now in INIT state.
Ready to initialize the orchestrator.
What would you like me to do?
```

### ‚úÖ CORRECT - MONITOR State:
```
Entering MONITOR, checking E3.1.1 status now...
E3.1.1: In progress, 312 lines added
Checking E3.1.2 status now...
E3.1.2: Review pending
```

### ‚ùå WRONG - MONITOR State:
```
I'm now in MONITOR state.
I'll monitor the agents' progress.
Monitoring mode activated.
```

## THE GOLDEN RULE

**States are COMMANDS, not LOCATIONS. When you enter a state, EXECUTE THE COMMAND!**
