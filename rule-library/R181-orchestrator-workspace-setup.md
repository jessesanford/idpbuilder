# ðŸš¨ðŸš¨ðŸš¨ RULE R181 - Orchestrator MUST Set Up Workspaces ðŸš¨ðŸš¨ðŸš¨

## Rule Statement
The orchestrator agent MUST set up proper working copies/workspaces for all agents before spawning them. Each agent requires an isolated directory structure to prevent conflicts and ensure clean implementation.

## Rationale
Without proper workspace isolation, agents will:
- Conflict with each other's work
- Corrupt the main working copy
- Violate the one-agent-per-effort principle
- Create merge conflicts and integration issues

## Implementation Requirements

### 1. Workspace Creation Protocol
```bash
# For each effort, create isolated working copy
effort_dir="idpbuidler-oci-build-push-phase${PHASE}-wave${WAVE}-effort${EFFORT}"
mkdir -p "/tmp/workspaces/$effort_dir"
cd "/tmp/workspaces/$effort_dir"

# Clone or set up as needed
git clone --single-branch --branch "$BASE_BRANCH" "$REPO_URL" .
```

### 2. Directory Structure
```
/tmp/workspaces/
â”œâ”€â”€ project-phase1-wave1-effort1/
â”œâ”€â”€ project-phase1-wave1-effort2/  
â”œâ”€â”€ project-phase1-wave1-effort3/
â””â”€â”€ project-phase1-wave2-effort1/
```

### 3. Verification Steps
- Verify directory doesn't already exist
- Ensure proper permissions
- Confirm Git repository initialized
- Check branch tracking configured

## Enforcement
- **Trigger**: Before spawning any implementation agent
- **Validation**: Directory exists and is properly configured
- **Failure**: Stop orchestration if workspace setup fails
