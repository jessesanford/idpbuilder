# üö®üö®üö® BLOCKING: RULE R310 - Split Scope Strict Adherence Protocol üö®üö®üö®

**Category:** Implementation Control  
**Agents:** SW Engineer (PRIMARY), Code Reviewer  
**Criticality:** BLOCKING - Over-engineering causes 3-5X size violations  
**Penalty:** -100% for exceeding split scope, -50% for unrequested features

## üî¥üî¥üî¥ SUPREME DIRECTIVE: IMPLEMENT EXACTLY WHAT'S SPECIFIED üî¥üî¥üî¥

**NO MORE, NO LESS - EVEN IF IT SEEMS INCOMPLETE!**

## The Critical Problem This Solves

**CATASTROPHIC VIOLATIONS FROM PRODUCTION:**

### üö® THE 2667% VIOLATION - WORST CASE EVER RECORDED üö®
```
Split Plan Said: "Implement 3 files in pkg/builder" (~572 lines)
SW Engineer Did: Implemented 80 files across 26 packages (ENTIRE CODEBASE)
Result: 2667% scope violation - Complete project failure
Root Cause: Copy-pasted entire repo without reading plan
```

### üö® RECENT 3.4X VIOLATION FROM TRANSCRIPT:
```
Split-003 Plan Said: "Implement selected command files and utilities" (~650 lines)
SW Engineer Interpreted:
  - "selected" = all the important commands (not just listed ones)
  - "utilities" = complete utility module (not minimal helpers)
  - "handlers" = comprehensive handler system
  - No test count = add full test coverage (430 lines!)
Result: 2,215 lines instead of 650 (3.4X OVERRUN)
Root Cause: "Complete the feature" mindset vs "stay within budget"
Consequence: COMPLETE FAILURE - Split rejected, effort failed
```

### Previous Major Violation:
```
Split Plan Said: "Implement functional options pattern"
SW Engineer Did: Created 47 option functions, validation, Clone(), extensive tests
Result: 1,512 lines instead of 400 (3.8X OVERRUN)
Consequence: COMPLETE FAILURE - Split rejected, effort failed
```

## üö® MANDATORY ADHERENCE PROTOCOL

### 0. COMPLETE PRE-IMPLEMENTATION CHECKLIST (NEW - REQUIRED)

**BEFORE WRITING ANY CODE:**
```bash
# MANDATORY: Complete the pre-implementation checklist
cp $CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/templates/SW-ENGINEER-PRE-IMPLEMENTATION-CHECKLIST.md ./checklist-$(date +%s).md
echo "üìã Completing mandatory pre-implementation checklist..."
# Fill out the checklist completely
# This is NOT optional - it prevents 2667% violations
```

### 1. READ THE "DO NOT IMPLEMENT" SECTION FIRST

**Before writing ANY code:**
```bash
# MANDATORY: Extract and display what NOT to do
echo "‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê"
echo "üõë DO NOT IMPLEMENT LIST FROM SPLIT PLAN:"
echo "‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê"
grep -A 20 "DO NOT IMPLEMENT\|STOP BOUNDARIES\|FORBIDDEN" SPLIT-PLAN-*.md

# Acknowledge the boundaries
echo "‚úÖ I will NOT implement anything in the DO NOT list"
echo "‚úÖ I will STOP at the specified boundaries"
echo "‚úÖ I will RESIST adding 'helpful' extras"
```

### 2. COUNT BEFORE CODING - ENHANCED WITH FILE VALIDATION

**Extract exact counts from plan:**
```bash
# CRITICAL: Count FILES first (new requirement after 2667% violation)
FILE_COUNT=$(grep -c "^###.*File:" SPLIT-PLAN-*.md)
if [ -z "$FILE_COUNT" ] || [ "$FILE_COUNT" -eq 0 ]; then
    echo "üö® FATAL: No file count found in split plan!"
    echo "Split plans MUST specify exact files to implement"
    exit 1
fi

# Set HARD limits based on file count
MAX_FILES=$((FILE_COUNT * 2))  # 200% is absolute maximum
STOP_FILES=$((FILE_COUNT + 2))  # Stop if 2 files over

echo "üî¥üî¥üî¥ FILE COUNT ENFORCEMENT üî¥üî¥üî¥"
echo "  Files to implement: $FILE_COUNT (EXACTLY)"
echo "  Warning at: $STOP_FILES files"
echo "  AUTOMATIC FAILURE at: $MAX_FILES files"
echo "  Current violation record: 2667% (80 files instead of 3)"

# Parse the split plan for exact numbers
FUNCTION_COUNT=$(grep -i "EXACTLY.*functions\|IMPLEMENT.*functions" SPLIT-PLAN-*.md | grep -o '[0-9]+' | head -1)
METHOD_COUNT=$(grep -i "EXACTLY.*methods\|IMPLEMENT.*methods" SPLIT-PLAN-*.md | grep -o '[0-9]+' | head -1)
TEST_COUNT=$(grep -i "EXACTLY.*tests\|WRITE.*tests" SPLIT-PLAN-*.md | grep -o '[0-9]+' | head -1)

echo "üìä SCOPE LIMITS FOR THIS SPLIT:"
echo "  Files to implement: ${FILE_COUNT} (HARD LIMIT)"
echo "  Functions to implement: ${FUNCTION_COUNT:-0}"
echo "  Methods to implement: ${METHOD_COUNT:-0}"
echo "  Tests to write: ${TEST_COUNT:-0}"
echo "  ANYTHING ELSE: FORBIDDEN"

# Create a marker file to track start of implementation
touch .implementation-start-marker
```

### 3. IMPLEMENT ONLY WHAT'S EXPLICITLY NAMED

#### ‚ùå WRONG - Adding Unlisted Features:
```go
// Split plan says: "Implement WithImage, WithContext, WithPlatform"
// SW Engineer writes:
func WithImage(image string) Option { ... }      // ‚úÖ Correct
func WithContext(ctx context.Context) Option { ... } // ‚úÖ Correct  
func WithPlatform(platform string) Option { ... }    // ‚úÖ Correct
func WithTimeout(timeout time.Duration) Option { ... } // ‚ùå NOT IN PLAN!
func WithRetry(retries int) Option { ... }           // ‚ùå NOT IN PLAN!
func WithDebug(debug bool) Option { ... }            // ‚ùå NOT IN PLAN!
// Result: 6 functions instead of 3 = VIOLATION
```

#### ‚úÖ RIGHT - Exactly What's Listed:
```go
// Split plan says: "Implement WithImage, WithContext, WithPlatform"
// SW Engineer writes:
func WithImage(image string) Option { ... }      // ‚úÖ Listed
func WithContext(ctx context.Context) Option { ... } // ‚úÖ Listed
func WithPlatform(platform string) Option { ... }    // ‚úÖ Listed
// STOP HERE - Even if it seems incomplete!
```

### 4. VALIDATION CHECKPOINTS - ENHANCED WITH FILE MONITORING

#### Every 100 Lines (NEW - MANDATORY):
```bash
# MANDATORY: Check file count every 100 lines to prevent 2667% violations
check_file_count() {
    PLANNED_FILES=$(grep -c "^###.*File:" SPLIT-PLAN-*.md)
    ACTUAL_FILES=$(find . -type f -name "*.go" -newer .implementation-start-marker 2>/dev/null | wc -l)
    
    echo "üìä FILE COUNT CHECK (Every 100 lines):"
    echo "  Planned: $PLANNED_FILES files"
    echo "  Current: $ACTUAL_FILES files"
    echo "  Percentage: $(($ACTUAL_FILES * 100 / $PLANNED_FILES))%"
    
    if [[ $ACTUAL_FILES -gt $((PLANNED_FILES + 2)) ]]; then
        echo "‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING: Exceeding file count by more than 2!"
        echo "STOP and review your implementation!"
    fi
    
    if [[ $ACTUAL_FILES -gt $((PLANNED_FILES * 2)) ]]; then
        echo "üö®üö®üö® CATASTROPHIC FAILURE IMMINENT!"
        echo "You are at $(($ACTUAL_FILES * 100 / $PLANNED_FILES))% of planned files!"
        echo "This is approaching the 2667% violation record!"
        echo "STOP IMMEDIATELY!"
        exit 1
    fi
}

# Run this check after adding every ~100 lines
LINES_SINCE_CHECK=$(git diff --stat | tail -1 | awk '{print $4}')
if [ "$LINES_SINCE_CHECK" -gt 100 ]; then
    check_file_count
fi
```

#### After Each File:
```bash
# Count what you've actually implemented
ACTUAL_FILES=$(find . -type f -name "*.go" -newer .implementation-start-marker 2>/dev/null | wc -l)
ACTUAL_FUNCTIONS=$(grep -c "^func [A-Z]" *.go 2>/dev/null || echo 0)
ACTUAL_METHODS=$(grep -c "^func (.*) " *.go 2>/dev/null || echo 0)
ACTUAL_TESTS=$(grep -c "^func Test" *_test.go 2>/dev/null || echo 0)

echo "üìà CURRENT IMPLEMENTATION COUNT:"
echo "  Files: $ACTUAL_FILES / $FILE_COUNT üî¥ CRITICAL METRIC"
echo "  Functions: $ACTUAL_FUNCTIONS / $FUNCTION_COUNT"
echo "  Methods: $ACTUAL_METHODS / $METHOD_COUNT"  
echo "  Tests: $ACTUAL_TESTS / $TEST_COUNT"

# File violation check (HIGHEST PRIORITY)
if [ "$ACTUAL_FILES" -gt "$FILE_COUNT" ]; then
    echo "‚ùå VIOLATION: Too many files! You have $ACTUAL_FILES but plan specifies $FILE_COUNT!"
    echo "This is a $(($ACTUAL_FILES * 100 / $FILE_COUNT))% violation!"
    exit 1
fi

# Function violation check
if [ "$ACTUAL_FUNCTIONS" -gt "$FUNCTION_COUNT" ]; then
    echo "‚ùå VIOLATION: Too many functions! Remove extras!"
    exit 1
fi
```

#### Before Committing:
```bash
# Final scope validation
validate_split_scope() {
    echo "üîç FINAL SCOPE VALIDATION"
    
    # Check for forbidden patterns
    if grep -q "func.*Clone\|func.*Copy" *.go; then
        echo "‚ùå FOUND Clone/Copy methods - were these requested?"
        [ "$ALLOW_CLONE" != "true" ] && exit 1
    fi
    
    if grep -q "func.*Validate\|func.*Valid" *.go; then
        echo "‚ùå FOUND validation methods - were these requested?"
        [ "$ALLOW_VALIDATION" != "true" ] && exit 1
    fi
    
    if grep -q "// TODO\|// FIXME" *.go; then
        echo "‚ö†Ô∏è Found TODOs - don't add work for later!"
    fi
    
    echo "‚úÖ Scope validation passed"
}
```

## üõë WHEN THE PLAN SEEMS INSUFFICIENT

### DON'T ASSUME - ASK!

**If the split plan seems incomplete:**

```bash
# DO NOT DO THIS:
"The plan only lists 3 option functions but we need 15 for a complete implementation.
I'll add the other 12 to make it complete." # ‚ùå WRONG - 5X OVERRUN!

# DO THIS INSTEAD:
echo "üìã SCOPE CLARIFICATION NEEDED:"
echo "The split plan specifies 3 option functions: WithImage, WithContext, WithPlatform"
echo "This seems insufficient for a complete options pattern."
echo "Should I:"
echo "  A) Implement ONLY these 3 as specified (recommended)"
echo "  B) Wait for clarification on additional functions"
echo "Proceeding with Option A - implementing ONLY the 3 specified functions."
```

## üìè SIZE CALCULATION REALITY CHECK

### Realistic Line Counts (Go Example):

```go
// Simple option function: 10-20 lines
func WithImage(image string) Option {
    return func(c *Config) error {
        if image == "" {
            return fmt.Errorf("image cannot be empty")
        }
        c.Image = image
        return nil
    }
}

// With validation and docs: 30-50 lines
// With complex logic: 50-100 lines
// Full CRUD operations: 200-400 lines per resource
```

### Common Over-Engineering Patterns:

| Plan Says | SW Does | Result |
|-----------|---------|---------|
| "Basic struct" | Adds 15 methods | 5X overrun |
| "3 functions" | Implements 47 | 15X overrun |
| "Simple tests" | Full coverage | 10X overrun |
| "Core types" | Adds validation | 3X overrun |

## üî¥ ENFORCEMENT MECHANISMS

### Pre-Implementation Gate:
```bash
# Must acknowledge scope before starting
ACKNOWLEDGED=$(grep -c "I will NOT implement" .scope-ack)
[ "$ACKNOWLEDGED" -eq 0 ] && {
    echo "‚ùå Must acknowledge scope boundaries first!"
    exit 1
}
```

### Mid-Implementation Gate:
```bash
# Check every 100 lines added
LINES_ADDED=$(git diff --stat | tail -1 | awk '{print $4}')
if [ "$LINES_ADDED" -gt 100 ]; then
    validate_split_scope || exit 1
fi
```

### Pre-Commit Gate:
```bash
# Final validation before commit
EXCESS_FUNCTIONS=$(( $(grep -c "^func " *.go) - FUNCTION_COUNT ))
if [ "$EXCESS_FUNCTIONS" -gt 0 ]; then
    echo "‚ùå BLOCKING: $EXCESS_FUNCTIONS extra functions detected!"
    echo "Remove excess functions or split will be rejected!"
    exit 1
fi
```

## üéØ Success Criteria

A split implementation is successful when:

1. ‚úÖ Implements EXACTLY the named functions/methods
2. ‚úÖ Stays within specified line count
3. ‚úÖ Contains NO unrequested features
4. ‚úÖ Includes NO "helpful" extras
5. ‚úÖ Follows all "DO NOT" instructions
6. ‚úÖ Stops at specified boundaries

## üìä Grading Impact

- **FILE COUNT VIOLATIONS (MOST SEVERE):**
  - Exceeding by >200%: **-100% (AUTOMATIC FAILURE - NO APPEAL)**
  - Exceeding by >150%: **-100% (AUTOMATIC FAILURE)**
  - Exceeding by >100%: **-80%**
  - Exceeding by >50%: **-60%**
  
- **LINE COUNT VIOLATIONS:**
  - 3.4X overrun (like Split-003): **-100% (AUTOMATIC FAILURE)**
  - 2X-3X overrun: **-80%**
  - 1.5X-2X overrun: **-60%**
  
- **OTHER VIOLATIONS:**
  - Interpreting "selected" as "all": **-75%**
  - Adding unrequested features: **-50% per feature**
  - Ignoring "DO NOT" instructions: **-75%**
  - "Completing" partial implementations: **-50%**
  - Adding tests when not specified: **-40%**
  - Refactoring without request: **-25%**
  - Not completing pre-implementation checklist: **-40%**

## üí° Mental Model

**Think of splits like LEGO instructions:**
- Step says "Add 3 red blocks" ‚Üí Add EXACTLY 3 red blocks
- Don't add blue blocks because they'd look nice
- Don't add 5 red blocks to make it "stronger"
- Don't skip ahead to step 10
- Don't go back and "improve" step 1

## üîë Key Phrases to Internalize

- "If it's not listed, don't implement it"
- "Incomplete is better than oversized"
- "The plan is the contract"
- "Stop means stop"
- "Ask, don't assume"
- "Selected means ONLY the ones explicitly named"
- "Stay within budget, don't complete the feature"
- "Partial implementation is the goal"

## Examples of Proper Adherence

### Example 1: Options Implementation
```
Plan: Implement WithImage, WithContext, WithPlatform (3 functions)
Did: Implemented exactly those 3 functions
Size: 145 lines (well under 400 limit)
Result: SUCCESS ‚úÖ
```

### Example 2: Struct Definition
```
Plan: Define Config struct with 5 fields, no methods
Did: Created struct with 5 fields, added no methods
Size: 35 lines
Result: SUCCESS ‚úÖ
```

### Example 3: Test Implementation
```
Plan: Write 3 basic tests, one per function
Did: Wrote exactly 3 tests, no edge cases
Size: 90 lines
Result: SUCCESS ‚úÖ
```

## Summary

**The #1 cause of split failures is ambiguous language being interpreted as "make it complete".**

**RECENT FAILURES:**
- **3.4X OVERRUN**: "selected commands" ‚Üí ALL commands (2,215 lines vs 650)
- **2667% VIOLATION**: 80 files instead of 3 (complete copy-paste of repo)

This rule ensures:
- SW Engineers implement EXACTLY what's specified (FILE AND LINE COUNT CRITICAL)
- No interpretation of vague words like "selected", "utilities", "handlers"
- Mandatory pre-implementation checklist completion
- Incremental monitoring every 100 lines
- Automatic failure for major overruns
- "Stay within budget" mindset, not "complete the feature"
- Clear communication when scope seems insufficient

**Remember: The engineers aren't trying to fail - they think they're being helpful by completing features. The solution is EXPLICIT, UNAMBIGUOUS plans that make it impossible to misinterpret.**

**NEVER FORGET: "Selected" doesn't mean "all important ones" - it means ONLY the ones explicitly listed by name!**
