# RULE R255 - POST-AGENT WORK VERIFICATION AND RECOVERY

## üî¥üî¥üî¥ SUPREME LAW: VERIFY EVERY AGENT'S WORK LOCATION üî¥üî¥üî¥

**Rule ID:** R255
**Criticality:** BLOCKING - Wrong location = DELETE AND RESTART
**Applies to:** Orchestrator verifying ALL agent work
**States:** MONITOR, WAITING_FOR_EFFORT_PLANS, post-agent-completion

## THE RULE

After EVERY agent (SW Engineer, Code Reviewer, Architect) reports completion, the orchestrator MUST:

1. **VERIFY** work is in correct `/efforts/phase{X}/wave{Y}/{effort}` directory
2. **VERIFY** work is committed to correct branch
3. **VERIFY** work is pushed to correct remote
4. **DELETE AND RESTART** if ANY verification fails

## MANDATORY VERIFICATION PROTOCOL

```bash
verify_agent_work() {
    local AGENT_TYPE="$1"
    local EFFORT_NAME="$2"
    local PHASE="$3"
    local WAVE="$4"
    
    echo "üîç R255: POST-AGENT WORK VERIFICATION"

    # Check 1: Verify directory exists and has work
    if [ ! -d "$EXPECTED_DIR" ]; then
        echo "‚ùå R255 VIOLATION: Directory does not exist: $EXPECTED_DIR"
        return 1

## INTELLIGENT RECOVERY ASSESSMENT

Before deleting work, the orchestrator MUST assess if work is salvageable:

```bash
assess_salvageability() {

    local EXPECTED_BRANCH="phase${PHASE}/wave${WAVE}/${EFFORT_NAME}"
    local BASE_BRANCH="main"  # or from target-repo-config.yaml
    
    # SCENARIO 1: Work in wrong directory but correct content
    # SALVAGEABLE - Move files to correct location
    if [ -f "IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN.md" ] && [ "$(pwd)" != "$EXPECTED_DIR" ]; then

## SALVAGE EXAMPLES

### ‚úÖ SALVAGEABLE SCENARIOS:

**Example 1: Files in orchestrator root instead of effort directory**
```bash
# Agent created files in / instead of /efforts/phase1/wave1/api-types/
# Found: /IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN.md
# Expected: /efforts/phase1/wave1/api-types/IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN.md

echo "‚úÖ SALVAGING: Moving files to correct location"
mkdir -p efforts/phase1/wave1/api-types
mv IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN.md efforts/phase1/wave1/api-types/
cd efforts/phase1/wave1/api-types
git add IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN.md
git commit -m "fix: relocate misplaced plan [R255 salvage]"
git push origin phase1/wave1/api-types
```

**Example 2: Correct directory but wrong branch name**
```bash
# Work in: /efforts/phase1/wave1/api-types/
# Current branch: feature/api-types
# Expected branch: phase1/wave1/api-types

echo "‚úÖ SALVAGING: Moving commits to correct branch"
git checkout -b phase1/wave1/api-types main
git cherry-pick feature/api-types~3..feature/api-types
git push -u origin phase1/wave1/api-types
git branch -D feature/api-types
```

**Example 3: Work not committed/pushed**
```bash
# Work in correct location but git status shows uncommitted
echo "‚úÖ SALVAGING: Committing and pushing work"
git add -A
git commit -m "feat: implement api-types [R255 recovery]"
git push origin phase1/wave1/api-types
```

### ‚ùå NOT SALVAGEABLE SCENARIOS:

**Example 1: Wrong repository entirely**
```bash
# Agent cloned personal fork instead of upstream
# Remote: https://github.com/agent/kcp-fork
# Expected: https://github.com/kcp-dev/kcp

echo "‚ùå NOT SALVAGEABLE: Wrong repository base"
echo "Must delete and start fresh with correct repo"
rm -rf efforts/phase1/wave1/api-types
# Reclone from correct source
```

**Example 2: Work conflicts with existing branch**
```bash
# Agent based work on outdated main branch
# Conflicts with current phase1/wave1/api-types branch

echo "‚ùå NOT SALVAGEABLE: Merge conflicts detected"
echo "Work is incompatible with existing branch"
rm -rf efforts/phase1/wave1/api-types
# Start fresh to avoid breaking existing work
```

**Example 3: Wrong effort code**
```bash
# Agent implemented webhook code in api-types directory
# grep shows "package webhook" in api-types effort

echo "‚ùå NOT SALVAGEABLE: Code for wrong effort"
echo "Found webhook code in api-types directory"
rm -rf efforts/phase1/wave1/api-types
# Must restart with correct implementation
```

## RECOVERY PROTOCOL - DELETE AND RESTART

When verification fails, the orchestrator MUST FIRST try to salvage:

```bash
recover_from_wrong_location() {
    local AGENT_TYPE="$1"
    local EFFORT_NAME="$2"
    local PHASE="$3"
    local WAVE="$4"
    local FAILURE_REASON="$5"
    
    echo "üö®üö®üö® R255 RECOVERY PROTOCOL ACTIVATED üö®üö®üö®"
    echo "Agent worked in WRONG location or didn't commit/push!"
    echo "Failure: $FAILURE_REASON"
    
    # STEP 1: Try to salvage the work first
    echo "üîß Attempting to salvage work..."
    if assess_salvageability "$AGENT_TYPE" "$EFFORT_NAME" "$PHASE" "$WAVE"; then
        echo "‚úÖ Work successfully salvaged! No restart needed."
        return 0
    fi
    
    echo "‚ùå Work cannot be salvaged - proceeding with DELETE AND RESTART"
    
    # Step 1: Document the violation
    cat >> "R255-violations.log" << EOF
$(date): $AGENT_TYPE failed verification for $EFFORT_NAME
Reason: $FAILURE_REASON
Phase: $PHASE, Wave: $WAVE
EOF
    
    # Step 2: Reset the effort state
    local EFFORT_DIR="efforts/phase${PHASE}/wave${WAVE}/${EFFORT_NAME}"
    
    echo "üóëÔ∏è Deleting any incorrect work..."
    if [ -d "$EFFORT_DIR" ]; then
        # Save any salvageable work to temp
        cp -r "$EFFORT_DIR" "/tmp/R255-backup-$(date +%s)-${EFFORT_NAME}" 2>/dev/null
        
        # Reset the directory
        cd "$(pwd)"  # Return to orchestrator directory
        rm -rf "$EFFORT_DIR"
    fi
    
    # Step 3: Recreate clean infrastructure
    echo "üîß Recreating clean effort infrastructure..."
    mkdir -p "$EFFORT_DIR"
    cd "$EFFORT_DIR"
    
    # Clone and setup branch
    git clone --sparse --filter=blob:none "$TARGET_REPO_URL" .
    git sparse-checkout init --cone
    git sparse-checkout set pkg/
    git checkout -b "phase${PHASE}/wave${WAVE}/${EFFORT_NAME}"
    git push -u origin "phase${PHASE}/wave${WAVE}/${EFFORT_NAME}"
    
    cd "$(pwd)"  # Return to orchestrator directory
    
    # Step 4: Update state to restart
    echo "üìù Updating orchestrator state to restart effort..."
    yq -i ".efforts_in_progress.${EFFORT_NAME}.status = \"RESTARTING_R255\"" orchestrator-state.yaml
    yq -i ".efforts_in_progress.${EFFORT_NAME}.violations += [\"R255: Wrong location/no push\"]" orchestrator-state.yaml
    
    # Step 5: Respawn agent with ENHANCED instructions
    respawn_with_enhanced_instructions "$AGENT_TYPE" "$EFFORT_NAME" "$PHASE" "$WAVE"
}

respawn_with_enhanced_instructions() {
    local AGENT_TYPE="$1"
    local EFFORT_NAME="$2"
    local PHASE="$3"
    local WAVE="$4"
    
    local EFFORT_DIR="$(pwd)/efforts/phase${PHASE}/wave${WAVE}/${EFFORT_NAME}"
    
    echo "üîÑ RESPAWNING $AGENT_TYPE with ENHANCED INSTRUCTIONS"
    
    # Create ultra-specific instructions
    local ENHANCED_PROMPT="‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL R255 RESTART - YOU PREVIOUSLY WORKED IN THE WRONG LOCATION! ‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è

YOU MUST FOLLOW THESE EXACT STEPS OR FACE DELETION:

1. IMMEDIATELY CD TO THIS EXACT DIRECTORY (COPY AND PASTE):
   cd $EFFORT_DIR

2. VERIFY YOU ARE IN THE CORRECT DIRECTORY:
   pwd
   MUST OUTPUT EXACTLY: $EFFORT_DIR
   
3. VERIFY CORRECT GIT BRANCH:
   git branch --show-current
   MUST OUTPUT EXACTLY: phase${PHASE}/wave${WAVE}/${EFFORT_NAME}

4. DO ALL YOUR WORK IN THIS DIRECTORY ONLY!
   - NEVER cd to any other directory
   - NEVER create files outside this directory
   - ALL code goes in: $EFFORT_DIR/pkg/

5. AFTER COMPLETING WORK, YOU MUST:
   git add -A
   git commit -m \"feat: implement $EFFORT_NAME\"
   git push origin phase${PHASE}/wave${WAVE}/${EFFORT_NAME}

6. FINAL VERIFICATION BEFORE REPORTING COMPLETE:
   pwd  # Must show: $EFFORT_DIR
   git status  # Must show: nothing to commit, working tree clean
   git log --oneline -1  # Must show your commit
   git branch -vv  # Must show tracking origin

‚ö†Ô∏è FAILURE TO FOLLOW THESE STEPS = YOUR WORK WILL BE DELETED AND YOU'LL START OVER! ‚ö†Ô∏è

Original task: [Include original task here]"

    # Spawn with enhanced prompt
    echo "Task: $AGENT_TYPE"
    echo "Prompt: $ENHANCED_PROMPT"
    echo "Effort: $EFFORT_NAME"
    
    # Record restart attempt
    echo "$(date): Restarted $AGENT_TYPE for $EFFORT_NAME with R255 enhancement" >> "R255-restarts.log"
}
```

## CONTINUOUS MONITORING

The orchestrator must check after EVERY agent interaction:

```bash
# In MONITOR state
monitor_agent_completion() {
    local AGENT_ID="$1"
    
    # When agent reports completion
    if [ "$AGENT_STATUS" = "COMPLETE" ]; then
        echo "üîç Agent $AGENT_ID reports complete - Running R255 verification..."
        
        if ! verify_agent_work "$AGENT_TYPE" "$EFFORT_NAME" "$PHASE" "$WAVE"; then
            echo "‚ùå R255 VERIFICATION FAILED!"
            recover_from_wrong_location "$AGENT_TYPE" "$EFFORT_NAME" "$PHASE" "$WAVE" "$FAILURE_REASON"
        else
            echo "‚úÖ R255 VERIFICATION PASSED - Work accepted"
        fi
    fi
}
```

## GRADING IMPACT

- First violation: -20% (warning, restart)
- Second violation same effort: -40% (critical, restart)
- Third violation same effort: -100% (AUTOMATIC FAILURE)
- Not checking at all: -100% (AUTOMATIC FAILURE)

## DETECTION HELPERS

```bash
# Quick check if work exists in wrong places
find_misplaced_work() {
    echo "üîç Searching for misplaced work..."
    
    # Look for work outside efforts directory
    find . -type f -name "*.go" ! -path "./efforts/*" -print 2>/dev/null
    find . -type f -name "IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN.md" ! -path "./efforts/*" -print 2>/dev/null
    
    # Check for uncommitted work
    for effort_dir in efforts/phase*/wave*/*/; do
        if [ -d "$effort_dir/.git" ]; then
            cd "$effort_dir"
            if [ -n "$(git status --porcelain)" ]; then
                echo "‚ö†Ô∏è Uncommitted work in: $effort_dir"
            fi
            cd - >/dev/null
        fi
    done
}

# Verify all efforts have correct remotes
verify_all_remotes() {
    for effort_dir in efforts/phase*/wave*/*/; do
        if [ -d "$effort_dir/.git" ]; then
            cd "$effort_dir"
            local BRANCH=$(git branch --show-current)
            local REMOTE=$(git config --get branch."$BRANCH".remote)
            
            if [ "$REMOTE" != "origin" ]; then
                echo "‚ùå Wrong/missing remote for: $effort_dir"
            fi
            cd - >/dev/null
        fi
    done
}
```

## MANDATORY ACKNOWLEDGMENT

The orchestrator MUST acknowledge:

"I understand R255: I MUST verify every agent's work is in the correct /efforts/ directory, committed, and pushed. If not, I MUST delete the work and restart the agent with enhanced instructions. Failure to verify = AUTOMATIC FAILURE."

## SALVAGE DECISION MATRIX

| Scenario | Salvageable? | Action | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|---------|
| Files in wrong directory | ‚úÖ YES | Move to correct location | Found in `/`, move to `/efforts/phase1/wave1/api-types/` |
| Correct directory, wrong branch | ‚úÖ YES | Cherry-pick to correct branch | On `feature/api`, cherry-pick to `phase1/wave1/api-types` |
| Uncommitted work, correct location | ‚úÖ YES | Commit and push | `git add -A && git commit && git push` |
| Wrong branch, no conflicts | ‚úÖ YES | Rebase or cherry-pick | Rebase onto correct branch |
| Stale branch, can fast-forward | ‚úÖ YES | Merge or rebase | `git pull --rebase origin main` |
| Work for correct effort | ‚úÖ YES | Verify and relocate if needed | Code matches effort name |
| Wrong repository base | ‚ùå NO | Delete and restart | Cloned fork instead of upstream |
| Merge conflicts with target | ‚ùå NO | Delete to avoid breaking | Would break existing work |
| Wrong effort code | ‚ùå NO | Delete and restart | Webhook code in api-types directory |
| Corrupted git history | ‚ùå NO | Delete and restart | Rebase/merge broke history |
| Mixed effort code | ‚ùå NO | Delete and restart | Multiple efforts in one directory |
| Based on wrong base branch | ‚ùå NO | Delete and restart | Based on `develop` not `main` |

### Partially Salvageable Work
```bash
# Some files good, others bad
echo "‚ö†Ô∏è PARTIAL SALVAGE: Saving good files only"

# Save good files
cp "$EXPECTED_DIR/IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN.md" /tmp/salvage/
cp "$EXPECTED_DIR/work-log.md" /tmp/salvage/

# Delete everything
rm -rf "$EXPECTED_DIR"

# Recreate and restore good files
mkdir -p "$EXPECTED_DIR"
cd "$EXPECTED_DIR"
git clone --sparse "$TARGET_REPO" .
git checkout -b "$EXPECTED_BRANCH"

# Restore salvaged files
cp /tmp/salvage/* .
git add -A
git commit -m "fix: restore salvaged work [R255 partial recovery]"
git push origin "$EXPECTED_BRANCH"
```

### Cross-Effort Contamination
```bash
# Agent mixed api-types and webhook code
echo "‚ùå NOT SALVAGEABLE: Cross-effort contamination"
echo "Found:"
echo "  - pkg/apis/... (correct for api-types)"
echo "  - pkg/webhook/... (WRONG - belongs to different effort)"
echo "Cannot untangle - must restart clean"
```

### Salvage with Manual Intervention
```bash
# Complex case needing human decision
echo "‚ö†Ô∏è NEEDS MANUAL REVIEW: Complex salvage scenario"
echo "Options:"
echo "  1. Interactive rebase to fix history"
echo "  2. Manual cherry-pick of specific commits"
echo "  3. Patch extraction and reapplication"

# Save patch for manual review
git format-patch main.."$CURRENT_BRANCH" -o /tmp/R255-patches/

echo "Patches saved to /tmp/R255-patches/ for manual review"
echo "Proceeding with DELETE AND RESTART"
```

## WHY THIS MATTERS

1. **Prevents lost work** - Work in wrong directories won't be found
2. **Ensures integration** - Only properly located work can be merged
3. **Maintains isolation** - Each effort must stay in its directory
4. **Enables tracking** - Can't track progress of misplaced work
5. **Avoids conflicts** - Wrong branches cause merge disasters

## VIOLATIONS TO DETECT

- Work created in orchestrator root directory
- Work created in /tmp or home directories  
- Files created but not committed
- Commits made but not pushed
- Work on wrong git branch
- No sparse checkout (full repo clone)
- Cross-effort contamination
