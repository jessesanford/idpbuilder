# 🔴🔴🔴 RULE R325: ATOMIC STATE TRANSITIONS 🔴🔴🔴

## Rule Identifier
**Rule ID:** R325  
**Category:** State Machine Control  
**Criticality:** 🔴🔴🔴 SUPREME LAW  
**Introduced:** Version 2.0.325  
**Related:** R322, R324, R206

## Rule Statement

**STATE TRANSITIONS MUST BE ATOMIC - EITHER FULLY COMPLETE OR NOT AT ALL!**

A state transition consists of FIVE mandatory steps that MUST execute as an atomic unit:
1. Complete current state work
2. Update current_state to new state  
3. Commit the state change
4. Push to remote
5. Stop and await continuation

If ANY step fails, the ENTIRE transition fails.

## The Atomic Transition Protocol

### 🔴🔴🔴 THE ONLY CORRECT PATTERN 🔴🔴🔴

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# ATOMIC STATE TRANSITION FUNCTION
perform_atomic_state_transition() {
    local FROM_STATE="$1"
    local TO_STATE="$2"
    
    echo "════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════"
    echo "🔄 ATOMIC STATE TRANSITION: $FROM_STATE → $TO_STATE"
    echo "════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════"
    
    # STEP 1: Verify we're in the expected state
    CURRENT=$(yq '.current_state' orchestrator-state.json)
    if [ "$CURRENT" != "$FROM_STATE" ]; then
        echo "❌ FATAL: Expected to be in $FROM_STATE but found $CURRENT"
        echo "❌ ATOMIC TRANSITION ABORTED"
        exit 1
    fi
    
    # STEP 2: Update the state file (THE CRITICAL PART!)
    echo "📝 Updating current_state to $TO_STATE..."
    yq -i ".current_state = \"$TO_STATE\"" orchestrator-state.json || {
        echo "❌ FATAL: Failed to update current_state"
        exit 1
    }
    
    yq -i ".previous_state = \"$FROM_STATE\"" orchestrator-state.json || {
        echo "❌ FATAL: Failed to update previous_state"
        exit 1
    }
    
    yq -i ".transition_time = \"$(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)\"" orchestrator-state.json || {
        echo "❌ FATAL: Failed to update transition_time"
        exit 1
    }
    
    # STEP 3: Verify the update worked
    NEW_STATE=$(yq '.current_state' orchestrator-state.json)
    if [ "$NEW_STATE" != "$TO_STATE" ]; then
        echo "❌ FATAL: State update verification failed!"
        echo "❌ Expected: $TO_STATE, Found: $NEW_STATE"
        exit 1
    fi
    echo "✅ Verified: current_state = $TO_STATE"
    
    # STEP 4: Commit atomically
    git add orchestrator-state.json || {
        echo "❌ FATAL: Failed to stage state file"
        exit 1
    }
    
    git commit -m "state: atomic transition from $FROM_STATE to $TO_STATE (R325)" || {
        echo "❌ FATAL: Failed to commit state transition"
        exit 1
    }
    
    # STEP 5: Push to remote
    git push || {
        echo "❌ FATAL: Failed to push state transition"
        echo "⚠️ WARNING: Local state updated but not persisted to remote!"
        echo "⚠️ Manual intervention required!"
        exit 1
    }
    
    # STEP 6: Confirm completion
    echo "✅ ATOMIC TRANSITION COMPLETE"
    echo "✅ State persisted: $FROM_STATE → $TO_STATE"
    echo "✅ Ready to stop per R322"
    
    # STEP 7: Stop message
    echo ""
    echo "🛑 STOPPING - State transition complete"
    echo "📊 Current state in file: $TO_STATE"
    echo "⏸️ Use /continue-orchestrating to resume from $TO_STATE"
    
    return 0
}

# USAGE EXAMPLE:
perform_atomic_state_transition "ANALYZE_IMPLEMENTATION_PARALLELIZATION" "SPAWN_AGENTS"
```

## Why Atomicity Matters

### The Problem Without Atomicity:
1. **Partial Updates**: State file updated but not committed = lost on crash
2. **Inconsistent State**: Some fields updated, others not = corruption
3. **Loop Bugs**: current_state not updated = infinite repetition
4. **Lost Work**: Transition not pushed = other agents see old state
5. **Race Conditions**: Multiple updates interleaved = chaos

### The Solution With Atomicity:
1. **All or Nothing**: Either the transition succeeds completely or fails completely
2. **Consistency**: State file always in valid state
3. **Persistence**: Changes always saved and pushed
4. **Verification**: Each step verified before proceeding
5. **Recovery**: Clear error messages for manual intervention

## Integration with R322 and R324

This rule COMBINES R322 and R324 into an atomic operation:

- **R322**: Mandates stopping at state transitions
- **R324**: Mandates updating state before stopping  
- **R325**: Mandates doing both ATOMICALLY

### The Complete Flow:
```
1. Complete state work (R322 requirement)
2. Update state file (R324 requirement)
3. Verify update (R325 atomicity)
4. Commit changes (R325 atomicity)
5. Push to remote (R325 atomicity)
6. Stop and wait (R322 requirement)
```

## Examples

### ✅ CORRECT: Atomic Transition
```bash
# Complete ANALYZE_IMPLEMENTATION_PARALLELIZATION work
echo "✅ Analysis complete, all implementation plans reviewed"

# Perform atomic transition
perform_atomic_state_transition "ANALYZE_IMPLEMENTATION_PARALLELIZATION" "SPAWN_AGENTS"

# Script exits here - transition is complete and persisted
```

### ❌ WRONG: Non-Atomic (Causes Bugs!)
```bash
# Complete work
echo "✅ Analysis complete"

# WRONG - Not atomic, steps can fail independently
echo "Transitioning to SPAWN_AGENTS"  # Just saying it
yq -i '.current_state = "SPAWN_AGENTS"' orchestrator-state.json  # What if this fails?
# Forgot to update previous_state
# Forgot to commit
echo "Stopping now"  # State not persisted!
```

### ❌ WRONG: Update After Stop
```bash
# Complete work
echo "✅ Analysis complete"

# WRONG - Stop first
echo "Stopping before transition"
exit 0

# This never runs!
yq -i '.current_state = "SPAWN_AGENTS"' orchestrator-state.json
```

## Enforcement

### Success Criteria
- ✅ All 5 atomic steps complete successfully
- ✅ State file shows new state
- ✅ Git log shows transition commit
- ✅ Remote has latest state
- ✅ No infinite loops on restart

### Failure Conditions
- ❌ Any step fails = entire transition fails = -50% penalty
- ❌ Partial update = corrupted state = -100% FAILURE
- ❌ No verification = potential loops = -30% penalty
- ❌ No push = lost state = -40% penalty
- ❌ Continue after transition = R322 violation = -100% FAILURE

## Critical Reminders

1. **NEVER** update just some fields - update ALL transition fields
2. **NEVER** stop without committing - changes will be lost
3. **NEVER** continue after updating - must stop per R322
4. **ALWAYS** verify the update before committing
5. **ALWAYS** push immediately after commit

## Debugging Atomic Transitions

If a transition fails:

```bash
# Check current state
echo "Current state in file:"
yq '.current_state' orchestrator-state.json

# Check git status
echo "Git status:"
git status

# Check last commit
echo "Last transition commit:"
git log --oneline -n 5 | grep "state:"

# Manual recovery if needed
yq -i '.current_state = "CORRECT_STATE"' orchestrator-state.json
git add orchestrator-state.json
git commit -m "fix: manual state correction after failed atomic transition"
git push
```

## Grading Impact

- **Missing atomicity**: -50% penalty
- **Infinite loop caused**: -100% IMMEDIATE FAILURE
- **Partial state update**: -75% penalty
- **No verification**: -25% penalty
- **Perfect atomic transition**: +10% bonus

## Notes

- This rule prevents the most critical orchestrator bugs
- Atomicity ensures consistency even during failures
- Every state transition MUST use this pattern
- No exceptions, no shortcuts
- The function can be copied and reused
