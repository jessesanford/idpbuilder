**This rule has been consolidated into R300: Comprehensive Fix Management Protocol**
**Please use R300 for all fix management requirements**

# üö®üö®üö® RULE R292: Integration Fixes MUST Be In Effort Branches

## Classification
- **Category**: Integration Management
- **Criticality Level**: üö®üö®üö® BLOCKING
- **Enforcement**: MANDATORY for all integration fixes
- **Penalty**: -50% for violations, -100% for direct integration branch edits

## The Rule

**ALL fixes for integration failures MUST be made in the ORIGINAL EFFORT BRANCHES, never directly in integration branches.**

## üî¥üî¥üî¥ ABSOLUTE REQUIREMENT üî¥üî¥üî¥

**When integration fails (build, test, or demo):**
1. ‚úÖ ALWAYS fix in effort/feature branches FIRST
2. ‚úÖ ALWAYS push fixes to remote effort branches
3. ‚úÖ ALWAYS verify fixes exist in effort branches before re-integration
4. ‚úÖ ALWAYS re-merge from fixed effort branches
5. ‚úÖ ALWAYS use fresh integration branch from main (per R271)
6. ‚ùå NEVER edit integration branch directly
7. ‚ùå NEVER commit fixes to integration branch
8. ‚ùå NEVER proceed without verifying effort branches have fixes

## Why This Is Critical

### Correct Approach Benefits
When you fix in effort branches:
- ‚úÖ **Source branches stay correct** - Future integrations will work
- ‚úÖ **Clean merge history** - Can trace all changes to source
- ‚úÖ **PR reviews work** - Each effort fix can be reviewed
- ‚úÖ **Rollback possible** - Can revert individual efforts
- ‚úÖ **No drift** - Effort and integration stay synchronized
- ‚úÖ **CD compliance** - Maintains continuous delivery flow

### Wrong Approach Disasters
When you fix directly in integration branch:
- ‚ùå **Source branches stay broken** - Next integration fails again
- ‚ùå **Divergence created** - Integration differs from sources
- ‚ùå **Merge conflicts** - Future merges will conflict
- ‚ùå **Lost traceability** - Can't track fixes to efforts
- ‚ùå **No rollback** - Can't revert individual changes
- ‚ùå **CD violation** - Breaks continuous delivery principles

## üî¥üî¥üî¥ CRITICAL WORKFLOW - MUST FOLLOW üî¥üî¥üî¥

### THE ONLY CORRECT FIX WORKFLOW:
```
1. Integration fails (build/test/demo)
   ‚Üì
2. Identify which effort caused failure
   ‚Üì
3. Switch to that effort's branch
   ‚Üì
4. Apply fix in effort branch
   ‚Üì
5. Commit and push to effort branch
   ‚Üì
6. Verify fix is in remote effort branch
   ‚Üì
7. Create NEW integration branch from main
   ‚Üì
8. Merge ALL effort branches (including fixed)
   ‚Üì
9. Test integration again
```

**ANY DEVIATION FROM THIS WORKFLOW = AUTOMATIC FAILURE**

## Implementation Protocol

### Step 1: Identify Failed Integration
```bash
# Integration demo fails
./demo-features.sh
# Output: ‚ùå Build failed / Tests failed / Runtime error
```

### Step 2: Trace Failure to Effort
```bash
# Analyze which effort caused the failure
analyze_failure() {
    echo "üîç Tracing failure to source effort..."
    
    # Check git blame for error location
    git blame src/failed-module.ts | grep "effort"
    
    # Check commit history
    git log --oneline --grep="effort"
    
    # Identify effort branch
    echo "Failure traced to: feature/effort-name"
}
```

### Step 3: Fix in Effort Branch
```bash
# ‚úÖ CORRECT: Switch to effort branch
fix_in_effort_branch() {
    local effort_branch="feature/effort-name"
    
    # Checkout effort branch
    git checkout "$effort_branch"
    git pull origin "$effort_branch"
    
    # Apply fixes
    edit src/module.ts  # Fix the actual issue
    
    # Test locally
    npm test
    npm run build
    
    # Commit to effort branch
    git add -A
    git commit -m "fix: resolve integration failure in effort-name"
    git push origin "$effort_branch"
}

# ‚ùå WRONG: Never do this!
wrong_approach() {
    git checkout integration-wave-1
    edit src/module.ts  # NEVER EDIT IN INTEGRATION BRANCH!
    git commit -m "fix: patch integration"  # VIOLATION!
}
```

### Step 4: Re-integrate Fixed Effort
```bash
# Create new integration attempt with fixed code
reintegrate_fixed_effort() {
    # Start fresh
    git checkout main
    git pull origin main
    git checkout -b integration-wave-1-fix-$(date +%s)
    
    # Merge all efforts including fixed one
    git merge origin/feature/effort-1 --no-ff
    git merge origin/feature/effort-2-FIXED --no-ff  # With fix
    git merge origin/feature/effort-3 --no-ff
    
    # Test integration again
    npm install
    npm run build
    ./test-harness.sh
    ./demo-features.sh
}
```

```

## Common Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Build Compilation Error
```bash
# Error: TypeScript compilation failed in module from effort-2
# ‚úÖ CORRECT:
git checkout feature/effort-2
# Fix TypeScript error
git push origin feature/effort-2
# Re-integrate

# ‚ùå WRONG:
git checkout integration-wave-1
# Fix TypeScript error directly
```

### Scenario 2: Test Failure
```bash
# Error: Integration test fails due to effort-3 API change
# ‚úÖ CORRECT:
git checkout feature/effort-3
# Update API and tests
git push origin feature/effort-3
# Re-integrate

# ‚ùå WRONG:
git checkout integration-wave-1
# Patch test to pass
```

### Scenario 3: Missing Dependency
```bash
# Error: Module from effort-1 missing dependency
# ‚úÖ CORRECT:
git checkout feature/effort-1
# Add dependency to package.json
git push origin feature/effort-1
# Re-integrate

# ‚ùå WRONG:
git checkout integration-wave-1
# Add dependency directly
```

## Enforcement Checkpoints

### 1. Code Reviewer Verification
```bash
# Code reviewer MUST verify fixes are in effort branches
verify_fix_location() {
    # Check no direct commits to integration
    git log integration-wave-1 --format="%s" | grep -i "fix:" && {
        echo "‚ùå VIOLATION: Fixes found in integration branch!"
        exit 1
    }
    
    # Verify effort branches have fixes
    for effort in effort-1 effort-2 effort-3; do
        git log "feature/$effort" --format="%s" | grep -i "fix:" || {
            echo "‚ö†Ô∏è No fixes in $effort branch"
        }
    done
}
```

### 2. Orchestrator Enforcement
```bash
# Orchestrator MUST spawn SWEs to fix in effort branches
spawn_for_fixes() {
    # NEVER allow direct integration fixes
    if [[ "$TARGET_BRANCH" == "integration-"* ]]; then
        echo "‚ùå BLOCKED: Cannot spawn SWE for integration branch!"
        echo "Must fix in effort branch instead"
        exit 1
    fi
}
```

### 3. State Machine Enforcement
```yaml
# State machine blocks progression if fixes not in effort branches
MONITORING_INTEGRATION:
  on_demo_failure:
    - verify_no_integration_edits()
    - require_effort_branch_fixes()
    - block_if_violated()
```

## Grading Penalties

- Fix directly in integration branch: **-50%**
- Claim fix but effort branch still broken: **-50%**
- Integration branch diverged from efforts: **-75%**
- Repeated violations: **-100% (FAIL)**

## Success Criteria

Before any integration fix is complete:
- ‚úÖ Original effort branch has fix committed
- ‚úÖ Fix is pushed to remote effort branch
- ‚úÖ Integration branch has NO direct fixes
- ‚úÖ Re-integration merges fixed effort branches
- ‚úÖ Demo passes with properly fixed code
- ‚úÖ All effort branches remain deployable

## Remember

**"Fix at the source, not at the symptom"**
**"Effort branches are the truth, integration is the proof"**
**"A fix in integration is a future failure waiting to happen"**

Direct integration fixes are TECHNICAL DEBT that WILL cause future failures!
