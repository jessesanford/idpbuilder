# üö®üö®üö® BLOCKING: RULE R311 - Effort Scope Strict Adherence Protocol üö®üö®üö®

**Category:** Implementation Control  
**Agents:** SW Engineer (PRIMARY), Code Reviewer  
**Criticality:** BLOCKING - Over-engineering causes 3-5X size violations  
**Penalty:** -100% for exceeding effort scope, -50% for unrequested features

## üî¥üî¥üî¥ SUPREME DIRECTIVE: IMPLEMENT EXACTLY WHAT'S SPECIFIED üî¥üî¥üî¥

**NO MORE, NO LESS - EVEN IF IT SEEMS INCOMPLETE!**

## The Critical Problem This Solves

**THE MINDSET PROBLEM:**
Engineers want to "complete features" but efforts need "partial implementations"

**ACTUAL VIOLATION FROM PRODUCTION:**
```
Effort Plan Said: "Implement authentication service"
SW Engineer Did: Added OAuth2, JWT, SAML, session management, 2FA, password reset
Result: 2,847 lines instead of 600 (4.7X OVERRUN)
Consequence: COMPLETE FAILURE - Effort rejected, required emergency split
```

**RECENT SPLIT-003 VIOLATION FROM TRANSCRIPT:**
```
Plan Said: "selected command files and utilities"
SW Thought: "I should implement all important commands to make it work"
Result: 2,215 lines instead of 650 (3.4X OVERRUN)
Root Cause: "Complete the feature" mindset instead of "stay within budget"
```

## üö® MANDATORY ADHERENCE PROTOCOL

### 0. ADOPT THE CORRECT MINDSET

**‚ùå WRONG MINDSET (Causes overruns):**
- "This feature needs X, Y, and Z to work properly"
- "I should make this production-ready"
- "While I'm here, I'll add this related thing"
- "This seems incomplete without authentication"

**‚úÖ CORRECT MINDSET (Stays within budget):**
- "I will implement ONLY what's explicitly listed"
- "Other efforts will handle the missing pieces"
- "Incomplete is intentional and expected"
- "My job is to stay within budget, not complete the feature"

### 1. READ THE "DO NOT IMPLEMENT" SECTION FIRST

**Before writing ANY code:**
```bash
# MANDATORY: Extract and display what NOT to do
echo "‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê"
echo "üõë DO NOT IMPLEMENT LIST FROM EFFORT PLAN:"
echo "‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê"
grep -A 20 "DO NOT IMPLEMENT\|SCOPE BOUNDARIES\|FORBIDDEN" EFFORT-IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN.md

# Acknowledge the boundaries
echo "‚úÖ I will NOT implement anything in the DO NOT list"
echo "‚úÖ I will STOP at the specified boundaries"
echo "‚úÖ I will RESIST adding 'helpful' extras"
```

### 2. EXTRACT EXACT SPECIFICATIONS

**Parse the effort plan for explicit items:**
```bash
# Extract exact specifications
echo "üìä EXACT SCOPE FOR THIS EFFORT:"
grep -A 10 "IMPLEMENT EXACTLY\|EXACTLY What to Implement" EFFORT-IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN.md

# Count specific items
FUNCTION_COUNT=$(grep -c "^  - Function:" EFFORT-IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN.md)
ENDPOINT_COUNT=$(grep -c "^  - Endpoint:" EFFORT-IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN.md)
TYPE_COUNT=$(grep -c "^  - Type:" EFFORT-IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN.md)

echo "  Functions to implement: ${FUNCTION_COUNT:-0}"
echo "  Endpoints to implement: ${ENDPOINT_COUNT:-0}"
echo "  Types to define: ${TYPE_COUNT:-0}"
echo "  ANYTHING ELSE: FORBIDDEN WITHOUT JUSTIFICATION"
```

### 3. IMPLEMENT ONLY WHAT'S EXPLICITLY NAMED

#### ‚ùå WRONG - Adding Unlisted Features:
```go
// Effort plan says: "Implement basic authentication with login endpoint"
// SW Engineer writes:
func HandleLogin(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) { ... }  // ‚úÖ Correct
func HandleLogout(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) { ... } // ‚ùå NOT IN PLAN!
func HandleRefreshToken(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) { ... } // ‚ùå NOT IN PLAN!
func Handle2FA(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) { ... }    // ‚ùå NOT IN PLAN!
func HandlePasswordReset(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) { ... } // ‚ùå NOT IN PLAN!
// Result: 5 endpoints instead of 1 = VIOLATION
```

#### ‚úÖ RIGHT - Exactly What's Listed:
```go
// Effort plan says: "Implement basic authentication with login endpoint"
// SW Engineer writes:
func HandleLogin(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) { ... }  // ‚úÖ Listed
// STOP HERE - Even if logout seems essential!
```

### 4. JUSTIFICATION PROTOCOL FOR NECESSARY ADDITIONS

**If you TRULY need something not in the plan:**

```bash
# STOP AND THINK
echo "‚ö†Ô∏è ADDITION CONSIDERATION:"
echo "Need to add: [describe addition]"
echo "Reason: [why it's ESSENTIAL, not just nice]"
echo "Impact if omitted: [what BREAKS without it]"
echo "Line count: [estimated lines]"

# Document in implementation report
cat >> IMPLEMENTATION-REPORT.md << EOF
## Justified Additions
### Addition: [Name]
- **What**: [Description]
- **Why Essential**: [Not just "nice to have"]
- **What Breaks Without It**: [Specific failure]
- **Lines Added**: [Count]
- **Approved By**: [Self-review justification]
EOF
```

### 5. VALIDATION CHECKPOINTS

#### After Each Major Component:
```bash
# Validate scope adherence
validate_effort_scope() {
    echo "üîç SCOPE VALIDATION CHECKPOINT"
    
    # Count actual implementations
    ACTUAL_FUNCS=$(grep -c "^func " *.go 2>/dev/null || echo 0)
    ACTUAL_ENDPOINTS=$(grep -c "HandleFunc\|Handler(" *.go 2>/dev/null || echo 0)
    
    echo "üìà Current implementation:"
    echo "  Functions: $ACTUAL_FUNCS"
    echo "  Endpoints: $ACTUAL_ENDPOINTS"
    
    # Check for scope creep
    if grep -q "OAuth\|SAML\|JWT" *.go && ! grep -q "OAuth\|SAML\|JWT" EFFORT-IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN.md; then
        echo "‚ùå VIOLATION: Adding authentication methods not in plan!"
        exit 1
    fi
}
```

## üõë WHEN THE PLAN SEEMS INSUFFICIENT

### ASK BEFORE ASSUMING

**If the effort plan seems to miss something critical:**

```markdown
## SCOPE CLARIFICATION REQUEST

The effort plan specifies:
- Login endpoint only
- No logout functionality

This seems incomplete because:
- Users who log in need a way to log out
- Sessions will accumulate without cleanup

Options:
A) Implement ONLY login as specified ‚úÖ (RECOMMENDED)
B) Add logout with justification in report
C) Request plan clarification

Proceeding with Option A - implementing ONLY what's specified.
```

## üìè REALISTIC SIZE GUIDELINES

### Typical Component Sizes:

| Component | Simple | Medium | Complex |
|-----------|--------|--------|---------|
| REST Endpoint | 30-50 lines | 75-150 lines | 200-300 lines |
| Service Function | 20-40 lines | 50-100 lines | 150-250 lines |
| Data Model | 10-30 lines | 40-80 lines | 100-200 lines |
| Unit Test | 15-30 lines | 40-70 lines | 100-150 lines |
| Integration Test | 30-60 lines | 80-150 lines | 200-400 lines |

### Over-Engineering Red Flags:

| Plan Says | SW Does | Why It's Wrong |
|-----------|---------|----------------|
| "Basic auth" | Adds OAuth2, SAML | 10X complexity increase |
| "CRUD endpoints" | Adds search, filter, sort | 3X size increase |
| "Simple service" | Adds caching, retry logic | 5X complexity |
| "Data model" | Adds validation, serialization | 4X size increase |

## üî¥ ENFORCEMENT MECHANISMS

### Pre-Implementation Gate:
```bash
# Must extract and acknowledge scope
if ! test -f .scope-acknowledgment; then
    echo "‚ùå Must acknowledge effort scope first!"
    echo "Run: validate_effort_scope > .scope-acknowledgment"
    exit 1
fi
```

### During Implementation:
```bash
# Monitor line growth
LINES_ADDED=$(git diff --stat | tail -1 | awk '{print $4}')
EFFORT_LIMIT=800

if [ "$LINES_ADDED" -gt 500 ]; then
    echo "‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING: Approaching effort limit ($LINES_ADDED/800)"
    echo "Focus on completing specified features only!"
fi
```

### Pre-Commit Gate:
```bash
# Final scope validation
check_effort_compliance() {
    # Check for unauthorized additions
    JUSTIFICATION_COUNT=$(grep -c "## Justified Additions" IMPLEMENTATION-REPORT.md)
    ADDITION_COUNT=$(grep -c "Added.*not in plan" git diff)
    
    if [ "$ADDITION_COUNT" -gt "$JUSTIFICATION_COUNT" ]; then
        echo "‚ùå BLOCKING: Unjustified additions detected!"
        echo "Either remove additions or document justification!"
        exit 1
    fi
}
```

## üéØ Success Criteria

An effort implementation is successful when:

1. ‚úÖ Implements EXACTLY the specified components
2. ‚úÖ Stays under 800 lines (hard limit)
3. ‚úÖ Contains NO unrequested features without justification
4. ‚úÖ Follows all "DO NOT" instructions
5. ‚úÖ Documents any essential additions with clear reasoning
6. ‚úÖ Stops at specified boundaries

## üìä Grading Impact

- Exceeding scope without justification: **-100% (AUTOMATIC FAILURE)**
- Adding "nice to have" features: **-50% per feature**
- Missing justification for additions: **-40%**
- Ignoring "DO NOT" instructions: **-75%**
- Over-engineering simple requirements: **-60%**

## üí° Key Mental Models

### The Restaurant Order Analogy
- Customer orders: "Hamburger with lettuce and tomato"
- ‚ùå WRONG: Add cheese, bacon, onions, special sauce (they seem good!)
- ‚úÖ RIGHT: Make exactly hamburger with lettuce and tomato
- If something seems missing: ASK, don't assume

### The Building Blueprint Analogy
- Blueprint shows: 3 rooms, 2 doors, 4 windows
- ‚ùå WRONG: Add a bathroom because "every house needs one"
- ‚úÖ RIGHT: Build exactly 3 rooms, 2 doors, 4 windows
- Missing bathroom? That's Phase 2's problem

## üîë Mantras to Remember

- **"If it's not specified, don't build it"**
- **"Incomplete today is better than oversized"**
- **"The plan is the contract, not a suggestion"**
- **"Adding features without asking is sabotage"**
- **"Document or delete additions"**
- **"Stay within budget, don't complete the feature"**
- **"Partial implementation is the goal"**
- **"Other efforts will handle what's missing"**

## Examples of Proper Adherence

### Example 1: Authentication Service
```
Plan: Implement login endpoint with username/password validation
Did: Created one endpoint, validated credentials, returned token
Did NOT: Add logout, refresh, password reset, 2FA
Size: 285 lines
Result: SUCCESS ‚úÖ
```

### Example 2: Data Service
```
Plan: Implement Create and Read operations for User model
Did: Implemented CreateUser and GetUser functions only
Did NOT: Add Update, Delete, List, Search operations
Size: 420 lines
Result: SUCCESS ‚úÖ
```

### Example 3: API Gateway
```
Plan: Implement request routing to 3 backend services
Did: Created router with exactly 3 route mappings
Did NOT: Add authentication, rate limiting, caching, logging
Size: 195 lines
Result: SUCCESS ‚úÖ
```

## Integration with R310 (Split Scope)

This rule works in harmony with R310:
- **R310**: Controls scope in split implementations
- **R311**: Controls scope in regular effort implementations
- **Same Principle**: Build only what's specified
- **Same Enforcement**: Strict boundaries and documentation

## Summary

**The #1 cause of effort failures is the "complete the feature" mindset when "partial implementation" is required.**

**KEY INSIGHT FROM TRANSCRIPT:**
Engineers aren't trying to break the system - they're trying to be helpful by making features complete. But the Software Factory REQUIRES partial implementations that fit within size budgets.

This rule ensures:
- SW Engineers adopt "stay within budget" mindset
- Partial implementations are recognized as intentional
- EXACTLY what's specified gets implemented
- Any additions require explicit justification
- Clear boundaries prevent scope creep

**Remember: Your job is NOT to complete the feature. Your job is to implement EXACTLY what's specified within the size budget. Other efforts will handle the rest.**
