# üö®üö®üö® RULE R257 - Mandatory Phase Assessment Report [BLOCKING]

## Rule Statement
**ARCHITECT MUST CREATE A PERMANENT PHASE ASSESSMENT REPORT FILE BEFORE ASSESSMENT COMPLETION**

The architect CANNOT signal phase assessment complete without:
1. Creating a standardized assessment report file
2. In the specified location with the exact naming convention
3. With all mandatory sections filled out
4. Verified by orchestrator before phase transition

## Why This Rule Exists

Previously, architects could provide verbal assessment through agent responses without creating any permanent record. This violated core principles:
- **No Audit Trail**: Phase decisions were not permanently documented
- **No Accountability**: No signed record of who approved what and when
- **No Verification**: Orchestrator couldn't verify assessment actually occurred
- **Lost Context**: Assessment details lost after conversation ended
- **No Metrics**: Scoring and evaluation data not preserved

## Enforcement Mechanism

### üö® MANDATORY FILE REQUIREMENTS

**File Name**: `PHASE-{N}-ASSESSMENT-REPORT.md`
- Example: `PHASE-1-ASSESSMENT-REPORT.md`
- Example: `PHASE-2-ASSESSMENT-REPORT.md`

**Location**: `phase-assessments/phase{N}/`
- Full path: `phase-assessments/phase1/PHASE-1-ASSESSMENT-REPORT.md`
- Directory must be created if it doesn't exist

**Creation Timing**: BEFORE signaling assessment complete
- Report MUST exist before architect returns decision
- Orchestrator MUST verify file exists and is valid

### üìã MANDATORY REPORT STRUCTURE

```markdown
# Phase {N} Assessment Report

## Assessment Metadata
**Report ID**: PHASE-{N}-ASSESSMENT-{YYYYMMDD}-{HHMMSS}
**Assessment Date**: {ISO-8601 timestamp}
**Assessed By**: architect-reviewer
**Phase Branch**: {branch name being assessed}
**Waves Completed**: {number of waves in phase}

## Assessment Decision
**DECISION**: [PHASE_COMPLETE|NEEDS_WORK|PHASE_FAILED]
**Confidence Level**: [HIGH|MEDIUM|LOW]
**Risk Assessment**: [LOW|MEDIUM|HIGH|CRITICAL]

```

## Implementation Requirements

### For Architect (PHASE_ASSESSMENT State)

```bash
# MANDATORY: Create assessment report
create_phase_assessment_report() {
    local PHASE=$1
    local DECISION=$2
    local REPORT_DIR="phase-assessments/phase${PHASE}"
    local REPORT_FILE="${REPORT_DIR}/PHASE-${PHASE}-ASSESSMENT-REPORT.md"
    
    # Create directory if needed
    mkdir -p "$REPORT_DIR"
    
    # Generate report with all mandatory sections
    cat > "$REPORT_FILE" << 'EOF'
# Phase ${PHASE} Assessment Report
[... complete report content ...]
EOF
    
    # Calculate and add hash for integrity
    local HASH=$(sha256sum "$REPORT_FILE" | cut -d' ' -f1)
    echo "**Report Hash**: $HASH" >> "$REPORT_FILE"
    
    # Commit and push immediately
    git add "$REPORT_FILE"
    git commit -m "assessment: Phase ${PHASE} assessment report - ${DECISION}"
    git push
    
    echo "‚úÖ Phase assessment report created: $REPORT_FILE"
}
```

### For Orchestrator (WAITING_FOR_PHASE_ASSESSMENT State)

```bash
# MANDATORY: Verify assessment report exists
verify_phase_assessment_report() {
    local PHASE=$1
    local REPORT_FILE="phase-assessments/phase${PHASE}/PHASE-${PHASE}-ASSESSMENT-REPORT.md"
    
    # Check file exists
    if [ ! -f "$REPORT_FILE" ]; then
        echo "‚ùå CRITICAL: No phase assessment report found!"
        echo "‚ùå Expected: $REPORT_FILE"
        echo "‚ùå Cannot proceed without assessment report"
        transition_to "ERROR_RECOVERY"
        exit 1
    fi
    
    # Extract and verify decision
    local DECISION=$(grep "^\*\*DECISION\*\*:" "$REPORT_FILE" | cut -d: -f2 | xargs)
    
    if [ -z "$DECISION" ]; then
        echo "‚ùå Invalid assessment report - no decision found!"
        transition_to "ERROR_RECOVERY"
        exit 1
    fi
    
    # Extract score
    local SCORE=$(grep "^\*\*TOTAL SCORE\*\*" "$REPORT_FILE" | grep -o "[0-9]\+" | tail -1)
    
    # Update state file with report location
    yq -i ".phase_assessment.report_file = \"$REPORT_FILE\"" orchestrator-state.yaml
    yq -i ".phase_assessment.decision = \"$DECISION\"" orchestrator-state.yaml
    yq -i ".phase_assessment.score = $SCORE" orchestrator-state.yaml
    
    echo "‚úÖ Phase assessment report verified:"
    echo "  üìÑ Report: $REPORT_FILE"
    echo "  üìä Decision: $DECISION"
    echo "  üìà Score: $SCORE"
    
    return 0
}

# MUST call this before processing architect decision
verify_phase_assessment_report "$CURRENT_PHASE"
```

## Validation Rules

### Report Validation Criteria
1. **File exists** at exact expected path
2. **All mandatory sections** present (not empty)
3. **Valid DECISION** value (PHASE_COMPLETE|NEEDS_WORK|PHASE_FAILED)
4. **Scores provided** for all categories
5. **Sign-off section** completed with timestamp
6. **Report hash** present for integrity

### Orchestrator Validation Steps
```bash
# Run all validations
validate_assessment_report() {
    local REPORT="$1"
    
    # Check mandatory sections
    for section in "Assessment Decision" "Scoring Summary" "Assessment Details" "Sign-Off"; do
        grep -q "^## $section" "$REPORT" || {
            echo "‚ùå Missing mandatory section: $section"
            return 1
        }
    done
    
    # Verify decision is valid
    grep -q "^\*\*DECISION\*\*: \(PHASE_COMPLETE\|NEEDS_WORK\|PHASE_FAILED\)" "$REPORT" || {
        echo "‚ùå Invalid or missing DECISION"
        return 1
    }
    
    # Verify sign-off exists
    grep -q "^\*\*Architect Sign-Off\*\*:" "$REPORT" || {
        echo "‚ùå Missing architect sign-off"
        return 1
    }
    
    echo "‚úÖ Assessment report validation passed"
    return 0
}
```

## Violations

**Severity**: BLOCKING - Phase cannot complete without report

**Detection**:
- Architect signals complete without creating report file
- Report file missing mandatory sections
- Invalid decision value in report
- Orchestrator proceeding without verifying report
- Report not committed to git

**Consequences**:
- Immediate transition to ERROR_RECOVERY
- Phase marked incomplete
- Architect must create proper report
- Orchestrator blocked from PHASE_COMPLETE
- Grading: -100 points (critical failure)

## Audit Commands

```bash
# Verify all completed phases have assessment reports
for phase_dir in phase-assessments/phase*/; do
    phase_num=$(basename "$phase_dir" | grep -o "[0-9]*")
    report_file="${phase_dir}PHASE-${phase_num}-ASSESSMENT-REPORT.md"
    
    if [ ! -f "$report_file" ]; then
        echo "‚ùå VIOLATION: Phase $phase_num missing assessment report!"
    else
        echo "‚úÖ Phase $phase_num has assessment report"
    fi
done

# Check for orphaned assessments (report without completion)
grep -l "PHASE_COMPLETE" phase-assessments/*/PHASE-*-ASSESSMENT-REPORT.md | while read report; do
    phase=$(basename "$report" | grep -o "[0-9]*")
    if ! grep -q "phase_${phase}_complete: true" orchestrator-state.yaml; then
        echo "‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING: Phase $phase has report but not marked complete"
    fi
done
```

## Summary

**The Phase Assessment Report is MANDATORY and BLOCKING**:
- Every phase assessment MUST produce a permanent report file
- The report MUST follow the exact structure and naming convention
- Orchestrator MUST verify the report before phase completion
- No verbal assessments allowed - everything must be documented
- Creates permanent audit trail for all phase decisions

This ensures accountability, traceability, and verifiability of all phase-level architectural decisions. NO PHASE CAN COMPLETE WITHOUT A PROPER ASSESSMENT REPORT.
