# 🔴🔴🔴 R235: MANDATORY PRE-FLIGHT VERIFICATION - SUPREME LAW #3 🔴🔴🔴

**Category:** SUPREME LAW  
**Agents:** ALL AGENTS (sw-engineer, code-reviewer, architect, orchestrator)  
**Criticality:** ABSOLUTE - VIOLATION = -100% GRADE (AUTOMATIC FAILURE)  
**Priority:** SUPREME LAW #3 - SUPERSEDES ALL OTHER RULES EXCEPT R234 AND R208

## 🚨🚨🚨 THIS IS SUPREME LAW #3 - NO EXCEPTIONS, NO OVERRIDES, NO RATIONALIZATIONS 🚨🚨🚨

### THE ABSOLUTE MANDATE

**EVERY AGENT MUST COMPLETE PRE-FLIGHT VERIFICATION BEFORE ANY WORK:**

1. **IMMEDIATE ON SPAWN** - Within 5 seconds of startup
2. **BEFORE ANY ACTION** - Not after "initial setup", IMMEDIATELY
3. **NO SKIPPING FOR ANY REASON** - Not for efficiency, not for continuous operation, NEVER
4. **FAILURE = IMMEDIATE EXIT** - Do NOT attempt to fix, just EXIT

### 🔴🔴🔴 THE FIVE MANDATORY CHECKS - ALL MUST PASS 🔴🔴🔴

## 🔴 ENFORCEMENT MECHANISMS

### 1. POSITION IN AGENT CONFIGURATION
This rule MUST appear:
- **IMMEDIATELY AFTER** the supreme laws section
- **BEFORE** any other rules or startup sequences
- **AS THE FIRST EXECUTABLE CODE** in pre-flight checks

### 2. EXIT CODES
- **Exit 235**: Pre-flight verification failure
- **NO RECOVERY**: Never attempt to cd, checkout, or "fix"
- **IMMEDIATE STOP**: Do not proceed with any work

### 3. GRADING IMPACT
```yaml
preflight_verification_violations:
  working_in_wrong_directory: -100%  # AUTOMATIC FAILURE
  working_in_wrong_repository: -100%  # AUTOMATIC FAILURE
  working_on_wrong_branch: -100%  # AUTOMATIC FAILURE
  no_workspace_isolation: -100%  # AUTOMATIC FAILURE
  contaminated_workspace: -100%  # AUTOMATIC FAILURE
  skipping_preflight_checks: -100%  # AUTOMATIC FAILURE
```

## 🔴 WHAT AGENTS MUST REFUSE

### AGENTS MUST PHYSICALLY REFUSE TO WORK IF:
1. **Wrong Repository**: In planning repo instead of target repo
2. **Wrong Branch**: Not on their assigned effort branch
3. **Wrong Directory**: Not in their effort directory
4. **No Isolation**: Working in main codebase instead of isolated effort
5. **Contamination**: Effort directory contains foreign code

### NO RATIONALIZATIONS ACCEPTED:
- ❌ "I'll just quickly fix this..." - NO, EXIT IMMEDIATELY
- ❌ "For efficiency I'll skip..." - NO, SUPREME LAW
- ❌ "I'm in continuous operation..." - NO, CHECKS ARE MANDATORY
- ❌ "I know what I'm doing..." - NO, FOLLOW THE LAW
- ❌ "The orchestrator said..." - NO, SUPREME LAW SUPERSEDES

## 🔴 ORCHESTRATOR SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS

The orchestrator MUST:
1. **Run pre-flight checks** before spawning ANY agent
2. **CD to correct directory** per R208 (Supreme Law #2)
3. **Verify target repository** is cloned, not planning repo
4. **Create proper isolation** before spawning agents
5. **REFUSE to spawn** if pre-flight checks fail

## 🔴 PROPAGATION REQUIREMENTS

This rule MUST be added to:
1. `/home/vscode/software-factory-template/.claude/agents/sw-engineer.md` - At TOP after supreme laws
2. `/home/vscode/software-factory-template/.claude/agents/code-reviewer.md` - At TOP after supreme laws
3. `/home/vscode/software-factory-template/.claude/agents/architect.md` - At TOP after supreme laws
4. `/home/vscode/software-factory-template/.claude/agents/orchestrator.md` - In supreme laws section as #3

## 🔴 VALIDATION SCRIPT

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# validate-r235-compliance.sh

validate_agent_preflight() {
    local AGENT="$1"
    local CONFIG="/home/vscode/software-factory-template/.claude/agents/${AGENT}.md"
    
    echo "Validating R235 compliance for $AGENT..."
    
    # Check if R235 is mentioned
    if grep -q "R235" "$CONFIG"; then
        echo "✅ R235 referenced in $AGENT"
    else
        echo "❌ R235 NOT FOUND in $AGENT - CRITICAL VIOLATION!"
        return 1
    fi
    
    # Check if it's marked as SUPREME LAW
    if grep -q "SUPREME LAW #3" "$CONFIG"; then
        echo "✅ R235 marked as SUPREME LAW #3"
    else
        echo "❌ R235 not marked as SUPREME LAW - MUST FIX!"
        return 1
    fi
    
    return 0
}

# Validate all agents
for agent in sw-engineer code-reviewer architect orchestrator; do
    validate_agent_preflight "$agent" || exit 1
done

echo "✅ All agents comply with R235"
```

## 🔴 SUMMARY

**R235 IS SUPREME LAW #3 - IT CANNOT BE VIOLATED FOR ANY REASON**

Every agent MUST:
1. Run pre-flight checks IMMEDIATELY on spawn
2. REFUSE to work if ANY check fails
3. NEVER attempt to fix or work around failures
4. EXIT with code 235 on violation

This prevents:
- Wrong repository contamination (planning vs target)
- Wrong branch work
- Missing workspace isolation
- Cross-effort contamination
- Directory confusion

**PENALTY FOR VIOLATION: -100% GRADE (AUTOMATIC FAILURE)**

---
**Created**: Emergency response to massive contamination crisis
**Effective**: IMMEDIATELY - ALL AGENTS MUST COMPLY
**Enforcement**: ABSOLUTE - NO EXCEPTIONS
