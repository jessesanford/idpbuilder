# üî¥üî¥üî¥ RULE R208: ORCHESTRATOR WORKING DIRECTORY SPAWN PROTOCOL - SUPREME LAW üî¥üî¥üî¥

## ABSOLUTE SUPREMACY DECLARATION

**THIS RULE IS SUPREME LAW #2 OF THE SOFTWARE FACTORY**
- **NO OTHER RULE CAN OVERRIDE THIS (except R234)**
- **NOT EFFICIENCY CONCERNS**
- **NOT TIME CONSTRAINTS**
- **NOT "CONTINUOUS OPERATION"**
- **NOT ANYTHING**

## VIOLATION = IMMEDIATE CATASTROPHIC FAILURE

**Penalty for ANY violation:**
- **-100% GRADE (AUTOMATIC FAIL)**
- **IMMEDIATE TERMINATION**
- **NO RECOVERY POSSIBLE**
- **NO EXCUSES ACCEPTED**

## THE SUPREME LAW OF SPAWNING

### YOU MUST ALWAYS CD BEFORE SPAWN - NO EXCEPTIONS EVER

**Category:** SUPREME LAW  
**Agent:** Orchestrator ONLY  
**Criticality:** üî¥üî¥üî¥ ABSOLUTE - VIOLATION = INSTANT FAILURE üî¥üî¥üî¥  
**Priority:** SUPREME - This rule CANNOT be overridden by ANY other rule

## üö®üö®üö® MISSION CRITICAL RULE üö®üö®üö®

**THE ONLY RELIABLE WAY TO SPAWN AGENTS IN THE CORRECT DIRECTORY IS FOR THE ORCHESTRATOR TO CHANGE TO THAT DIRECTORY FIRST!**

**SPAWNING WITHOUT CD'ING FIRST = -100% GRADE = AUTOMATIC FAILURE**

## The Problem This Solves

Agents inherit their working directory from their spawner. If the orchestrator spawns an agent while in the wrong directory, the agent starts in the wrong location and all subsequent work fails. This is the #1 cause of effort failures.

## üî¥üî¥üî¥ MANDATORY ENFORCEMENT - NO EXCEPTIONS üî¥üî¥üî¥

### EVERY SINGLE SPAWN MUST FOLLOW THIS EXACT SEQUENCE:

1. **DETERMINE** target directory for the agent
2. **CD** to that directory (MANDATORY - NO EXCEPTIONS)
3. **VERIFY** pwd output shows correct directory
4. **SPAWN** the agent (ONLY after successful CD)
5. **RETURN** to orchestrator directory

### FORBIDDEN ACTIONS (INSTANT FAILURE):
- ‚ùå Spawning without CD'ing first = **-100% GRADE**
- ‚ùå Assuming agent will CD itself = **-100% GRADE**
- ‚ùå Using --working-directory flag instead of CD = **-100% GRADE**
- ‚ùå Spawning from wrong directory "for efficiency" = **-100% GRADE**
- ‚ùå Skipping pwd verification = **-100% GRADE**

### THE ONLY ACCEPTABLE PATTERN:
```bash
# MANDATORY BEFORE EVERY SPAWN - NO EXCEPTIONS!
cd /path/to/effort/directory || exit 1
pwd  # MUST verify correct directory
/usr/bin/env bash -c 'task spawn agent-name "instructions"'
cd /original/directory  # Return after spawn
```

## The Protocol (MANDATORY)

### Step 1: THINK About Target Directory
```bash
# BEFORE ANY SPAWN, ASK:
# 1. What type of agent am I spawning?
# 2. Where does this agent need to work?
# 3. Does that directory exist?
# 4. Am I currently in that directory?

determine_agent_working_directory() {
    local AGENT_TYPE="$1"
    local EFFORT_NAME="$2"
    local SPLIT_NUM="${3:-}"
    
    case "$AGENT_TYPE" in
        "code-reviewer")
            if [ -n "$SPLIT_NUM" ]; then
                echo "efforts/phase${PHASE}/wave${WAVE}/${EFFORT_NAME}/split-${SPLIT_NUM}"
            else
                echo "efforts/phase${PHASE}/wave${WAVE}/${EFFORT_NAME}"
            fi
            ;;
        "sw-engineer")
            if [ -n "$SPLIT_NUM" ]; then
                echo "efforts/phase${PHASE}/wave${WAVE}/${EFFORT_NAME}/split-${SPLIT_NUM}"
            else
                echo "efforts/phase${PHASE}/wave${WAVE}/${EFFORT_NAME}"
            fi
            ;;
        "architect")
            echo "."  # Architect works from project root
            ;;
        *)
            echo "efforts/phase${PHASE}/wave${WAVE}/${EFFORT_NAME}"
            ;;
    esac
}
```

### Step 2: Save Current Directory
```bash
# ALWAYS save where you are before changing
ORCHESTRATOR_DIR=$(pwd)
echo "üìç Orchestrator currently in: $ORCHESTRATOR_DIR"
```

### Step 3: Create Target Directory (If Needed)
```bash
TARGET_DIR=$(determine_agent_working_directory "$AGENT_TYPE" "$EFFORT_NAME" "$SPLIT_NUM")

if [ ! -d "$TARGET_DIR" ]; then
    echo "üìÅ Creating target directory: $TARGET_DIR"
    mkdir -p "$TARGET_DIR"
    
    # For effort directories, also create standard structure
    if [[ "$TARGET_DIR" == *"effort-"* ]]; then
        mkdir -p "$TARGET_DIR"/{src,tests,docs}
        touch "$TARGET_DIR"/work-log.md
    fi
fi
```

### Step 4: CHANGE TO TARGET DIRECTORY
```bash
# THIS IS THE CRITICAL STEP!
echo "üîÑ Changing to target directory: $TARGET_DIR"
cd "$TARGET_DIR" || {
    echo "‚ùå FATAL: Cannot change to $TARGET_DIR"
    exit 1
}

# VERIFY we're in the right place
echo "‚úÖ Now in: $(pwd)"
```

### Step 5: Spawn the Agent
```bash
# NOW spawn the agent - it will inherit our current directory
echo "üöÄ Spawning $AGENT_TYPE in $(pwd)"

task spawn "$AGENT_TYPE" 
    --working-directory "$(pwd)" 
    --effort "$EFFORT_NAME" 
    --instructions "$INSTRUCTIONS"

# The agent is now running in the correct directory!
```

### Step 6: Return to Orchestrator Directory
```bash
# ALWAYS return to where you were
cd "$ORCHESTRATOR_DIR"
echo "üìç Returned to orchestrator directory: $(pwd)"
```

## Complete Spawn Function

## Usage Examples

### Example 1: Spawning Code Reviewer for Planning
```bash
# Orchestrator is in project root
pwd  # /workspaces/project

# Spawn code reviewer for effort planning
spawn_agent_in_correct_directory 
    "code-reviewer" 
    "effort-api-types" 
    "Create implementation plan for API types"

# Code reviewer starts in: /workspaces/project/efforts/phase1/wave1/effort-api-types
# Orchestrator returns to: /workspaces/project
```

### Example 2: Spawning SW Engineer for Split
```bash
# Orchestrator in project root
pwd  # /workspaces/project

# Spawn SW engineer for split-002
spawn_agent_in_correct_directory 
    "sw-engineer" 
    "effort-api-types" 
    "Implement split-002 per plan" 
    "002"

# SW engineer starts in: /workspaces/project/efforts/phase1/wave1/effort-api-types/split-002
# Orchestrator returns to: /workspaces/project
```

### Example 3: Spawning Architect for Review
```bash
# Orchestrator anywhere
pwd  # /workspaces/project/efforts/phase1/wave2/effort-controllers

# Spawn architect (needs project root)
spawn_agent_in_correct_directory 
    "architect" 
    "wave2" 
    "Review wave 2 completion"

# Architect starts in: /workspaces/project (root)
# Orchestrator returns to: /workspaces/project/efforts/phase1/wave2/effort-controllers
```

## Validation Checks

### Pre-Spawn Checklist
```bash
pre_spawn_validation() {
    echo "üîç R208 Pre-Spawn Validation"
    
    # 1. Know where you are
    echo "Current directory: $(pwd)"
    
    # 2. Know where agent needs to be
    echo "Target directory: $TARGET_DIR"
    
    # 3. Verify you can change there
    if [ -d "$TARGET_DIR" ] || mkdir -p "$TARGET_DIR" 2>/dev/null; then
        echo "‚úÖ Target directory accessible"
    else
        echo "‚ùå Cannot access/create target directory!"
        return 1
    fi
    
    # 4. Test the round trip
    local ORIGINAL=$(pwd)
    cd "$TARGET_DIR" && cd "$ORIGINAL" || {
        echo "‚ùå Cannot perform directory round trip!"
        return 1
    }
    
    echo "‚úÖ Pre-spawn validation passed"
}
```

## Common Failures (AND HOW TO PREVENT THEM)

### ‚ùå WRONG: Spawning without changing directory
```bash
# DON'T DO THIS!
task spawn sw-engineer "implement effort"
# Agent starts in whatever random directory orchestrator is in!
```

### ‚ùå WRONG: Assuming agent will cd itself
```bash
# DON'T DO THIS!
task spawn sw-engineer "cd to effort directory and implement"
# Agent might cd, but preflight checks run in wrong directory first!
```

### ‚ùå WRONG: Not creating directory first
```bash
# DON'T DO THIS!
cd efforts/phase1/wave1/effort-new/split-001  # Fails if doesn't exist!
```

### ‚úÖ CORRECT: Always use the protocol
```bash
# ALWAYS DO THIS!
spawn_agent_in_correct_directory 
    "sw-engineer" 
    "effort-new" 
    "implement" 
    "001"
```

## Integration Points

This rule MUST be referenced and applied at:

1. **SPAWN_AGENTS state** - Initial effort spawns
2. **CREATE_SPLIT_PLAN state** - Spawning code reviewer for splits
3. **SPLIT_IMPLEMENTATION state** - Spawning SW engineers for splits
4. **WAVE_REVIEW state** - Spawning architect
5. **FIX_ISSUES state** - Re-spawning for fixes
6. **ANY spawn operation** - No exceptions!

## üî¥ ABSOLUTE REQUIREMENTS - NO NEGOTIATION üî¥

1. **CD FIRST** - Always change directory before spawn
2. **VERIFY PWD** - Always verify you're in the right place
3. **SPAWN SECOND** - Only spawn after successful CD
4. **NO SHORTCUTS** - No efficiency bypasses allowed
5. **NO EXCEPTIONS** - This applies to EVERY spawn, ALWAYS

## Summary

**R208 IS SUPREME LAW #2 - IT CANNOT BE VIOLATED FOR ANY REASON**

1. **THINK** about where the agent needs to be
2. **CD** to that directory (MANDATORY)
3. **VERIFY** with pwd (MANDATORY)
4. **SPAWN** the agent (inherits directory)
5. **RETURN** to your original directory

**SPAWNING WITHOUT CD'ING FIRST = -100% GRADE = AUTOMATIC FAILURE**

This is not optional. This is not a suggestion. This is SUPREME LAW.
