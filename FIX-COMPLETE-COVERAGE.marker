==========================

Completed at: 2025-09-18 14:47:30 UTC
Effort: registry-helpers (E1.1.2C)
Branch: idpbuilder-oci-build-push/phase1/wave1/registry-helpers
Agent: sw-engineer

ISSUE ADDRESSED:
- Test coverage was 49.4% (below 80% requirement)
- client.go had 0% coverage (completely untested)
- Several functions lacked any test coverage

SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED:
1. Created comprehensive client_test.go file
   - Tests for NewAuthenticatedClient function
   - Tests for NewRegistryClient function  
   - Tests for CreateRequestWithAuth function
   - Edge cases, error conditions, and context handling

2. Enhanced image_test.go with missing function tests
   - Added tests for ImageReferenceWithTag function
   - Added tests for ImageReferenceWithDigest function
   - Comprehensive test coverage for all edge cases

3. Enhanced retry_test.go with HTTP retry tests
   - Added tests for RetryHTTPRequest function
   - Tests for success/failure scenarios
   - Tests for context cancellation and backoff progression

4. Enhanced url_test.go with normalization tests
   - Added tests for NormalizeRegistryURL function
   - Tests for URL normalization and idempotency
   - Edge cases and error conditions

RESULTS:
- Initial coverage: 49.4%
- Final coverage: 88.8% 
- Requirement: 80%
- Achievement: EXCEEDED by 8.8%

ALL TESTS PASSING: âœ…
- Total test functions: 21+
- All edge cases covered
- Error conditions tested
- Context handling verified

Status: FIX COMPLETE - Test coverage requirement satisfied
