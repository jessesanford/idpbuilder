- **Phase**: 2, Wave: 1
- **Reviewer**: Code Reviewer Agent
- **Total Splits**: 4
- **Overall Decision**: **FIX_ISSUES**

## Size Analysis

### Split-by-Split Line Count Analysis

| Split | Branch | Lines (from base) | Status | Verdict |
|-------|--------|-------------------|--------|---------|
| Split-001 | idpbuilder-oci-go-cr/phase2/wave1/E2.1.1-split-001 | 810 | ‚ö†Ô∏è EXCEEDS LIMIT | NEEDS_FIX |
| Split-002 | idpbuilder-oci-go-cr/phase2/wave1/E2.1.1-split-002 | 1969 (cumulative) | ‚ö†Ô∏è EXCEEDS LIMIT | NEEDS_FIX |
| Split-003 | idpbuilder-oci-go-cr/phase2/wave1/E2.1.1-split-003 | 679 | ‚úÖ COMPLIANT | PASSED |
| Split-004 | idpbuilder-oci-go-cr/phase2/wave1/E2.1.1-split-004 | 941 | ‚ö†Ô∏è EXCEEDS LIMIT | NEEDS_FIX |

**Base Branch Used**: idpbuilder-oci-go-cr/phase1-integration-20250902-194557
**Tool Used**: /home/vscode/workspaces/idpbuilder-oci-go-cr/tools/line-counter.sh

### Critical Size Violations

1. **Split-001**: 810 lines (10 lines over limit)
2. **Split-002**: Shows 1969 cumulative lines - appears to include Split-001's changes
3. **Split-004**: 941 lines (141 lines over limit)

## Implementation Structure Analysis

### File Distribution Across Splits

| Split | Non-Test Go Files | Test Files | Key Components |
|-------|------------------|------------|----------------|
| Split-001 | 63 | 24 | Base infrastructure from Phase 1 |
| Split-002 | 69 | 26 | Builder core implementation |
| Split-003 | 65 | 25 | Tarball operations |
| Split-004 | 68 | 25 | Advanced features and tests |

### Sequential Dependency Issues

**üî¥ CRITICAL ISSUE: Non-Sequential Implementation**

The splits appear to NOT follow proper sequential dependency patterns:
- Split-002 shows 1969 total lines from base (should be ~1610 if properly sequential)
- Split-003 shows only 679 lines from base (should be higher if building on Split-002)
- Split-004 shows 941 lines from base (should be cumulative)

This indicates the splits were likely implemented in parallel against the base branch rather than sequentially building on each other.

## Code Quality Assessment

### Test Coverage
- All splits have test files (24-26 test files each)
- Tests appear to timeout when executed (potential integration issues)
- Test-to-code ratio appears adequate based on file counts

### Git Status
- Uncommitted changes found in splits (IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN.md modifications)
- SPLIT-INVENTORY files not committed
- All splits on correct branch naming pattern

## Issues Found

### üî¥ Critical Issues (Must Fix)

1. **Size Violations**:
   - Split-001: 810 lines (EXCEEDS by 10 lines)
   - Split-004: 941 lines (EXCEEDS by 141 lines)
   - Rule R307 violation: Not independently mergeable due to size

2. **Sequential Dependency Chain Broken**:
   - Splits appear to be developed in parallel against base
   - Not following incremental build pattern
   - Rule R308 violation: Not properly incremental

3. **Test Execution Issues**:
   - Tests timeout when executed
   - Unable to verify test passing status

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Warning Issues

1. **Uncommitted Changes**:
   - Modified IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN.md files
   - SPLIT-INVENTORY files not tracked

2. **Branch Strategy Concern**:
   - All splits branch from phase1-integration
   - Should follow sequential branching for true splits

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions Required

1. **Re-split Oversized Splits**:
   - Split-001: Remove 10+ lines or create sub-split
   - Split-004: Requires significant reduction (141+ lines)

2. **Fix Sequential Dependencies**:
   - Split-002 should branch from Split-001
   - Split-003 should branch from Split-002
   - Split-004 should branch from Split-003

3. **Resolve Test Issues**:
   - Investigate test timeout causes
   - Ensure all tests pass before integration

4. **Commit All Changes**:
   - Commit IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN updates
   - Track SPLIT-INVENTORY files

## Integration Readiness

### Current Status: **NOT READY FOR INTEGRATION**

**Blocking Issues**:
- ‚ùå Size violations in 2 of 4 splits
- ‚ùå Sequential dependency chain not established
- ‚ùå Test execution status unknown
- ‚ùå Uncommitted changes present

### Required for Integration

Before these splits can be integrated:
1. All splits must be under 800 lines
2. Sequential dependency chain must be verified
3. All tests must pass
4. All changes must be committed

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate**: Address size violations in Split-001 and Split-004
2. **High Priority**: Fix sequential branching strategy
3. **Required**: Verify all tests pass
4. **Final**: Re-review after fixes applied

## Compliance Summary

- **R307 (Independent Branch Mergeability)**: ‚ùå FAILED - Size violations
- **R308 (Incremental Branching)**: ‚ùå FAILED - Not sequential
- **R198 (Line Counter Usage)**: ‚úÖ PASSED - Correct tool used
- **R200 (Measure Only Changeset)**: ‚úÖ PASSED - Correct measurement
- **R176 (Workspace Isolation)**: ‚úÖ PASSED - Proper directories
