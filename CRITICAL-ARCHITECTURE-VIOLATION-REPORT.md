# CRITICAL ARCHITECTURE VIOLATION REPORT

**Date**: 2025-09-15
**Severity**: CRITICAL
**State**: ERROR_RECOVERY (pending transition)

## Executive Summary

A fundamental Software Factory architecture violation has been discovered. ALL implementation code has been placed in the Software Factory repository instead of the target repository. This violates the core separation of concerns where:
- Software Factory repo = Planning and orchestration ONLY
- Target repo = Actual code implementation

## Violation Details

### Expected Architecture
- **Target Repository**: https://github.com/jessesanford/idpbuilder.git
  - Purpose: Receive all implementation code (OCI build/push features)
  - Base Branch: main

- **SF Repository**: https://github.com/jessesanford/idpbuilder-oci-build-push.git
  - Purpose: Planning, orchestration, state management ONLY
  - Should contain: Plans, states, rules, but NO implementation code

### What Actually Happened
1. ❌ ALL Phase 1 code was implemented in SF repo worktrees
2. ❌ ALL Phase 2 code was implemented in SF repo worktrees
3. ❌ Integration was done by merging within SF repo
4. ❌ The `pkg/` directory with Go code exists in SF repo
5. ❌ No code was ever pushed to the actual target repository

### Evidence
- Location: `/home/vscode/workspaces/idpbuilder-oci-build-push/worktrees/project-integration`
- Branch: `idpbuilder-oci-build-push/project-integration`
- Remote: `https://github.com/jessesanford/idpbuilder-oci-build-push.git` (WRONG!)
- Contains: Full `pkg/` directory with implementation code

## Root Cause Analysis

The agents were spawned with working directories pointing to worktrees within the SF repo itself, rather than cloning and working on the target repository. This happened because:

1. The worktree setup commands created worktrees from the SF repo
2. Agents implemented code in these SF repo worktrees
3. Integration happened by merging branches within SF repo
4. No agent ever cloned or worked on the actual target repo

## Impact Assessment

### Critical Issues
1. **Complete Architecture Violation**: The entire implementation exists in the wrong repository
2. **No Target Repo Code**: The actual target (idpbuilder) has received NO updates
3. **Mixing Concerns**: Planning/orchestration mixed with implementation
4. **Invalid Integration**: Integration happened in wrong repository

### Affected Components
- ALL Phase 1 efforts (certificate validation)
- ALL Phase 2 efforts (OCI build/push)
- ALL integration branches
- Project validation (validated wrong repo)

## Recovery Strategy

### Option 1: Complete Re-implementation (RECOMMENDED)
1. Start fresh with proper target repo clones
2. Re-spawn ALL agents with correct working directories
3. Re-implement all features in target repo
4. Properly integrate in target repo
5. Delete all code from SF repo

### Option 2: Migration Attempt
1. Extract all code from SF repo
2. Create patches for each effort
3. Apply patches to target repo
4. Re-do integration in target repo
5. Clean SF repo of all implementation

### Option 3: Salvage and Continue (NOT RECOMMENDED)
1. Accept the violation
2. Continue with wrong architecture
3. Document as technical debt
4. Plan future migration

## Immediate Actions Required

1. **STOP** all current work
2. **Transition** to ERROR_RECOVERY state
3. **Decision** on recovery strategy
4. **Clean** SF repo if proceeding with fix
5. **Restart** with proper architecture

## Lessons Learned

1. **Critical**: Must validate repository URLs before spawning agents
2. **Critical**: Worktrees must be created from TARGET repo, not SF repo
3. **Critical**: Agents must verify they're working in correct repo
4. **Critical**: Integration must happen in target repo

## Recommendation

**STRONGLY RECOMMEND Option 1**: Complete re-implementation with proper architecture. While this means redoing work, it ensures:
- Correct separation of concerns
- Clean architecture
- No technical debt
- Proper Software Factory pattern

The current state is fundamentally broken and continuing would violate core Software Factory principles.
