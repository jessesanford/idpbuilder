Total fixes applied: 4
Review report: CODE-REVIEW-REPORT-20250918-163234.md (now archived as COMPLETED)

## Fixes Applied:

### 1. MINOR: Go Formatting Issues
**Issue**: All test files needed gofmt formatting
**Fix Applied**:
- Ran `gofmt -w pkg/registry/types/*_test.go`
- Fixed formatting in 4 files: credentials_test.go, errors_test.go, options_test.go, registry_test.go
- All files now follow standard Go formatting

### 2. MINOR: Test Coverage Depth - Shallow Assertions
**Issue**: Tests were too shallow and didn't thoroughly validate behavior
**Example**: Line 36 in registry_test.go had weak assertion: `if (tt.cfg.URL != "") != tt.want`
**Fix Applied**:
- **registry_test.go**: Complete rewrite with comprehensive test cases
  - Added meaningful validations for all RegistryConfig fields
  - Added RetryPolicy testing with edge cases
  - Added RegistryInfo capability testing
  - Added ImageReference validation testing
  - Added nil pointer and edge case coverage
- **errors_test.go**: Enhanced error testing
  - Added comprehensive error message validation
  - Added error constructor testing with type checking
  - Added error constant validation
  - Added error wrapping and interface compliance testing
- **credentials_test.go**: Complete AuthConfig testing
  - Added validation logic for different auth types
  - Added TokenResponse testing with time validation
  - Added CredentialStore interface testing with mock implementation
  - Added comprehensive edge cases for invalid configurations
- **options_test.go**: Enhanced options testing
  - Added detailed ConnectionOptions testing with TLS, HTTP client, headers
  - Added PushOptions validation with parallel layers and platform checks
  - Added PullOptions testing with signature verification
  - Added ListOptions testing with pagination and filter validation

### 3. MINOR: Incomplete Error Testing
**Issue**: Error constructors tested but not error behavior
**Fix Applied**:
- Added comprehensive error behavior testing
- Added error wrapping and context validation
- Added error type checking and interface compliance
- Added error constant validation
- Added error detail handling for complex objects

### 4. MINOR: Missing Edge Cases
**Issue**: Tests didn't cover nil pointers, empty strings, or invalid configurations
**Fix Applied**:
- Added comprehensive nil pointer testing across all types
- Added empty string validation testing
- Added invalid configuration testing (negative values, missing required fields)
- Added boundary condition testing
- Added interface compliance testing

**Test Results**:
- All tests pass with 100% coverage
- 25 test functions with comprehensive sub-tests
- Edge cases covered: nil pointers, empty values, invalid configs, boundary conditions
- Production-ready test quality with meaningful assertions

**Status**: COMPLETE - All issues from CODE-REVIEW-REPORT-20250918-163234.md resolved
