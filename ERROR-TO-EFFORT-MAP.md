## Compilation Error Mapping

### Error: Syntax error - unexpected closing brace
- File: pkg/certs/chain_validator_test.go
- Line: 173
- Error Message: `expected declaration, found '}'`
- Original Effort: Unknown (certs package - likely from certificate validation implementation)
- Branch: integration-testing
- Category: Syntax Error
- Fix Strategy: Remove extra closing brace at line 173

## Linking Error Mapping
(No linking errors detected)

## Dependency Mapping
(No dependency issues detected)

## Effort Summary
| Effort | Errors | Priority | Estimated Complexity |
|--------|--------|----------|---------------------|
| certs  | 1      | 1        | Low                 |

## Fix Sequencing
Based on error analysis:
1. Fix syntax error in pkg/certs/chain_validator_test.go immediately
   - This is blocking the entire build
   - Simple one-line fix required
   - No dependencies on other fixes

## Notes
- This appears to be an integration error introduced during merging
- The fix is straightforward: remove the extra '}' at line 173
- No other errors were detected in the build
