## Compilation Error Mapping

### Error: undefined: types.ContainerListOptions
- File: pkg/kind/cluster_test.go
- Line: 232
- Original Effort: **PRE-EXISTING** (not from our implementation)
- Branch: main (original codebase)
- Category: Type/API mismatch
- Fix Strategy: Update to use correct Docker API types from current library version
- Notes: This is a pre-existing test failure in the original idpbuilder codebase

### Error: non-constant format string in call to (*testing.common).Fatalf
- File: pkg/util/git_repository_test.go
- Line: 102
- Original Effort: **PRE-EXISTING** (not from our implementation)
- Branch: main (original codebase)
- Category: Go testing best practice violation
- Fix Strategy: Change format string to be a constant, or use t.Errorf instead of t.Fatalf with dynamic format
- Notes: This is a pre-existing test issue in the original idpbuilder codebase

## Test Execution Error Mapping

### Error: fork/exec ../../../bin/k8s/1.29.1-linux-amd64/etcd: no such file or directory
- Component: TestReconcileCustomPkg, TestReconcileCustomPkgAppSet
- File: pkg/controllers/custompackage/controller_test.go
- Lines: 52, 265
- Original Effort: **PRE-EXISTING** (not from our implementation)
- Branch: main (original codebase)
- Missing Resource: etcd binary for test environment
- Fix Strategy: Either download the etcd binary to expected location, or update test to use testenv setup that doesn't require external binaries
- Notes: This is a pre-existing test infrastructure issue in the original idpbuilder codebase

## Effort Summary
| Effort | Errors | Priority | Estimated Complexity |
|--------|--------|----------|---------------------|
| Original Codebase (pre-existing) | 3 | 1 | Low |
| Phase 1 Efforts | 0 | N/A | N/A |
| Phase 2 Efforts | 0 | N/A | N/A |

## Important Finding
**All 3 test failures are PRE-EXISTING issues in the original idpbuilder codebase, not introduced by our implementation efforts.**

Our implementation efforts (Phase 1 Certificate Infrastructure and Phase 2 Build & Push) have not introduced any new test failures. The failures identified are:
1. Outdated Docker API usage in existing tests
2. Go testing best practice violations in existing tests  
3. Missing test infrastructure (etcd binary) for existing controller tests

## Fix Sequencing
Since all errors are in the original codebase and not interdependent:
1. Fix pkg/kind/cluster_test.go Docker API issue (simple type update)
2. Fix pkg/util/git_repository_test.go format string (simple syntax fix)
3. Fix pkg/controllers/custompackage test infrastructure (may require downloading binaries or updating test setup)

## Backport Requirements (R321)
Integration Context: Active (project-integration branch)
Backport Required: NO - These are pre-existing issues in the main branch, not from our effort branches

## Risk Assessment
- **Build Recovery Likelihood**: High (simple fixes)
- **Complexity**: Low (straightforward API and syntax updates)
- **Dependencies**: None (fixes are independent)
- **Impact on Our Implementation**: None (our code is not affected)
