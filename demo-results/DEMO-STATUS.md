# Demo Execution Status

## R291 Gate Check: FAILED

### Issue: No Demo Scripts Found
- Searched all effort directories for demo scripts
- No demo-features.sh files exist in any effort directory
- No alternative demo files found

### R291 Requirement
Per R291, demo scripts are MANDATORY for integration to proceed.
Each effort should have a demo-features.sh script that demonstrates its functionality.

### Integration Agent Note
As the Integration Agent, I cannot create demo scripts (R361 - NO new code).
This issue must be resolved by the SW Engineers.

### Required Actions
1. SW Engineers must create demo-features.sh in each effort directory
2. Demos must demonstrate the key functionality of each effort
3. All demos must pass before integration can be marked complete

### Efforts Missing Demos
- P1W1-E1: Provider Interface Definition - NO DEMO
- P1W1-E2: OCI Package Format - NO DEMO  
- P1W1-E3: Registry Configuration - NO DEMO
- P1W1-E4: CLI Interface Contracts - NO DEMO
