# Upstream Bugs Found During Integration

## Bug 1: Duplicate PushCmd Declaration
**File**: pkg/cmd/push/root.go:13 and pkg/cmd/push/push.go:18
**Issue**: PushCmd is declared in both files, causing compilation failure
**Error**: 
```
pkg/cmd/push/root.go:13:5: PushCmd redeclared in this block
pkg/cmd/push/push.go:18:5: other declaration of PushCmd
```
**Recommendation**: Remove one of the duplicate declarations
**Status**: NOT FIXED (upstream issue, documented per R266)

## Impact on Integration
The duplicate declaration prevents the code from building.
This must be fixed in the effort branches before integration can complete successfully.
