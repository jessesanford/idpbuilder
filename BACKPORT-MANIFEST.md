State: COORDINATE_BUILD_FIXES
Integration Context: ACTIVE - project-integration branch

## ðŸ”´ðŸ”´ðŸ”´ R321 ENFORCEMENT ðŸ”´ðŸ”´ðŸ”´
ALL fixes MUST be immediately backported to source branches!

## Fixes Requiring Backport

### Fix: kindlogger Format String Errors
- Source Branch: project-integration
- SW Engineer: SWE-1
- Fix Status: IN_PROGRESS
- Files to Backport:
  - [ ] pkg/kind/kindlogger.go (lines 26, 31)
- Original Effort Branch: TBD (need to identify which effort introduced this)
- Backport Status: PENDING

## Previously Completed Fixes (from markers)
### Previous Fix Sets (already handled)
- FIX-COMPLETE-SWE-2.marker - Status: COMPLETED
- FIX-COMPLETE-SWE-3.marker - Status: COMPLETED
- FIX-COMPLETE-SWE-4.marker - Status: COMPLETED

## Backport Execution Plan
1. After SWE-1 completes fix in project-integration
2. Identify original effort branch that introduced kindlogger.go
3. Checkout original effort branch
4. Apply same fixes to source
5. Test in isolation
6. Commit with integration reference
7. Push to remote

## Tracking Checklist
- [ ] Fix documented
- [ ] Source branch identified
- [ ] Fix commit recorded
- [ ] Backport completed
- [ ] Tests pass in source branch
- [ ] Ready for re-integration

## Commands for Backporting
```bash
# After fix is verified in project-integration
git checkout [original-effort-branch]
# Apply the same changes to pkg/kind/kindlogger.go
# Test the changes
go test ./pkg/kind/...
# Commit with reference
git commit -m "backport: fix format string errors from project-integration"
git push
```

## Notes
- This manifest tracks R321 compliance for immediate backporting
- All fixes in integration branches must be backported to prevent loss
- Re-integration will be required after backporting (R327)
