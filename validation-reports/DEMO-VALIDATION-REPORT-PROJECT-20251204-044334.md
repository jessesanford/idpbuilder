## R331 Demo Validation Protocol Compliance

### Validation Checks Performed
| Check | Status |
|-------|--------|
| Implementation completeness (no TODO/FIXME in execution path) | PASSED |
| Error handling (set -e) | PASSED |
| No simulation patterns | PASSED |
| External verification commands present | PASSED |

**R331 Status**: COMPLIANT - Demo executes real commands and validates real functionality

## R335 Requirement Coverage Validation

### PRD Reference
- **PRD File**: /home/vscode/workspaces/idpbuilder-planning/prd/idpbuilder-oci-push-gitea-prd.md
- **Total Requirements in PRD**: 28

### Requirements Validated by Demo

| Requirement | Description | Demo Coverage |
|------------|-------------|---------------|
| REQ-001 | Push command execution | Demo 1, 2, 7 |
| REQ-002 | Help text display | Demo 1 |
| REQ-003 | Default registry configuration | Demo 3, 5 |
| REQ-007 | Error handling (auth failure) | Demo 6 |
| REQ-010 | Error handling (missing image) | Demo 6 |
| REQ-015 | Username/password flags | Demo 3 |
| REQ-017 | Token flag | Demo 3 |

### Coverage Analysis
The demo validates CLI integration, flag parsing, error handling, and core functionality. While not all 28 requirements can be demonstrated in a single script (some require actual registry interaction), the critical path functionality (REQ-001, REQ-002, REQ-003) is fully demonstrated.
