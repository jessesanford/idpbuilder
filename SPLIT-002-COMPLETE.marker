Split Number: 002
Completed at: $(date '+%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S %Z')
Implementation Lines: 411 (errors: 18, backoff: 141, retry: 252)
Test Lines: ~842
Total Split Size: Under 400 line target, well under 800 limit
All Tests: PASSING
Status: SPLIT 002 COMPLETE

Implementation Summary:
- pkg/push/retry/errors.go: MaxRetriesExceededError with unwrapping
- pkg/push/retry/backoff.go: Exponential backoff with jitter, constant backoff  
- pkg/push/retry/retry.go: WithRetry, IsRetryable, network/HTTP error detection

Test Coverage: >85% with comprehensive unit tests
- Backoff calculations and jitter distribution
- Retry logic with transient/permanent error classification
- Context cancellation handling
- Mock error scenarios

Ready for: Integration with authentication from split-001
