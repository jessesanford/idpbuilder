## Integration Process Log

### Step 1: Initial Setup and Verification
- Timestamp: 2025-09-29T14:07:00Z
- Verified on correct branch: phase1-wave1-integration
- Working tree clean
- Ready to begin integration

### Step 2: Add Effort Repositories as Remotes
- Timestamp: 2025-09-29T14:09:00Z
- Added all 4 effort repositories as remotes
- Fetched all branches successfully

### Step 3: Merge E1.1.1 (Foundation)
- Timestamp: 2025-09-29T14:11:00Z
- Result: Conflicts in work-log.md and IMPLEMENTATION-COMPLETE.marker
- Resolution: Merged both sections, preserved all content
- Files added: ANALYSIS-REPORT.md and implementation plans

### Step 4: Merge E1.1.2-split-001 (Mock Registry Core)
- Timestamp: 2025-09-29T14:13:00Z
- Result: Conflict in work-log.md
- Resolution: Merged work log sections
- Files added: pkg/testutils/mock_registry.go, test_helpers.go, framework_test.go (660 lines)

### Step 5: Merge E1.1.2-split-002 (Test Utilities)
- Timestamp: 2025-09-29T14:15:00Z
- Result: Conflicts in pkg/testutils files (expected - split-002 extends split-001)
- Resolution: Accepted split-002 versions (theirs) as they contain complete implementation
- Files added: pkg/testutils/assertions.go (282 lines)
- Modified: Extended mock registry and test helpers (802 lines total)

### Step 6: Merge E1.1.3 (Integration Test Setup)
- Timestamp: 2025-09-29T14:18:00Z
- Result: Multiple conflicts (work-log, IMPLEMENTATION-COMPLETE.marker, go.mod, go.sum)
- Resolution:
  - Merged documentation sections
  - Kept base versions per R381 (no version updates policy)
  - Added testcontainers dependency from E1.1.3
- Files added: pkg/integration/ directory with 5 files (612 lines)

### Step 7: Post-Merge Validation
- Timestamp: 2025-09-29T14:20:00Z
- Ran go mod tidy: Success (dependencies resolved)
- Build attempt: FAILED due to upstream bugs
- Documented bugs per R266 (not fixed)
- Created comprehensive INTEGRATION-REPORT.md

## Upstream Bugs Documented (NOT FIXED)
1. **pkg/cmd/push/root.go:13:5** - PushCmd redeclared
2. **pkg/testutils/assertions.go** - Multiple MockRegistry method visibility issues

## Final Summary
✅ All 4 efforts successfully merged (E1.1.1, E1.1.2-split-001, E1.1.2-split-002, E1.1.3)
✅ Total lines integrated: ~2,103 (well within limits)
✅ All conflicts resolved intelligently
✅ Full documentation created
❌ Build fails due to upstream bugs (documented per R266)
⏸️ Tests blocked by build failure

## Integration Status: STRUCTURALLY COMPLETE
All merges successful. Build failures require developer fixes to upstream bugs.
