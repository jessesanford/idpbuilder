## Pre-Integration Setup

### Environment Verification
- ✅ Correct working directory confirmed
- ✅ On branch `idpbuilderpush/phase3/wave1/integration`
- ✅ Merge plan loaded from WAVE-MERGE-PLAN.md

### Rules Acknowledged
- R260-R267: Integration Agent Core Requirements
- R300: Comprehensive Fix Management Protocol
- R302: Split Tracking Protocol
- R306: Merge Ordering Protocol
- R361: No new code creation
- R381: Version consistency

## Integration Process

### Step 1: Pre-merge Verification
- ✅ Base commit verified: 468e329
- ✅ Fetched latest branches from origin
- ✅ Found split branches: split-003, split-004a, split-004b
- ⚠️ IMPORTANT DISCOVERY: split-004b does NOT contain split-004a
  - split-004b contains: split-002, split-003
  - split-004a is a separate branch based on split-003
  - Need to merge BOTH split-004a and split-004b

### Step 2: Adjusted Merge Strategy
Per R306 and R302, must merge in proper order:
1. First merge split-004a (contains up to split-003)
2. Then merge split-004b (which also contains up to split-003)
This will ensure all splits are integrated.
