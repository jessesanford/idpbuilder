# Build Failure Analysis Summary
Date: 2025-09-16T12:48:00Z
State: ANALYZE_BUILD_FAILURES

## Statistics
- Total Errors: 1
- Affected Efforts: 1 (certs/certificate validation)
- Critical Blockers: 1
- Estimated Fix Time: < 5 minutes

## Critical Findings
1. Syntax error in pkg/certs/chain_validator_test.go at line 173
2. Extra closing brace preventing go fmt from completing
3. Blocking the entire build process

## Recommended Approach
Strategy: Targeted fix
Rationale: This is a simple syntax error that can be fixed with a single line change. No complex refactoring required.

## Next Steps
1. Spawn Code Reviewer to create detailed fix plan
2. Code Reviewer will analyze the exact context around line 173
3. Code Reviewer will create FIX-PLAN document with the exact change needed
4. Then spawn SW Engineer to implement the fix

## Backport Requirements (R321)
Integration Context: Active (in integration-testing branch)
If active, ALL fixes must be immediately backported to:
- Source effort branch where the certs package was originally developed
- Any intermediate integration branches

## Risk Assessment
- Build Recovery Likelihood: High
- Complexity: Simple
- Dependencies: None
- This is a straightforward syntax fix with minimal risk
