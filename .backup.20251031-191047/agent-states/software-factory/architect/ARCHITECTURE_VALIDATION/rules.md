# Architect - ARCHITECTURE_VALIDATION State Rules

## State Context
This is the ARCHITECTURE_VALIDATION state for the architect within SF 3.0.

## SF 3.0 Validation Context

In this state, the Architect validates architectural compliance:
- Reads implementation outcomes from orchestrator-state-v3.json and `integration-containers.json`
- Validates architectural patterns and decisions were followed during implementation
- Identifies violations that may require `bug-tracking.json` entries for architectural debt
- Documents validation results for orchestrator to record in orchestrator-state-v3.json metadata
- All validation findings reported with atomic state updates per R288

## Acknowledgment Required
Thank you for reading the rules file for the ARCHITECTURE_VALIDATION state.

**IMPORTANT**: Please report that you have successfully read the ARCHITECTURE_VALIDATION rules file.

Say: "✅ Successfully read ARCHITECTURE_VALIDATION rules for architect"

## 🔴🔴🔴 MANDATORY MEASUREMENT RULE - R304 🔴🔴🔴

### R304: Mandatory Line Counter Tool Enforcement
**File**: `$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/rule-library/R304-mandatory-line-counter-enforcement.md`
**Criticality**: BLOCKING - Manual counting = AUTOMATIC -100% FAILURE

**ABSOLUTE REQUIREMENTS:**
- ✅ MUST use `$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/tools/line-counter.sh` for ALL line counting
- ❌ NEVER use `wc -l` or any manual counting method
- ❌ NEVER count lines any other way - this is a -100% automatic failure
- ✅ MUST specify both -b (base branch) and -c (current branch) parameters
- ✅ Base branch MUST be phase integration branch (NOT "main")

**Failure to use the line counter tool = AUTOMATIC -100% GRADE**

## State-Specific Rules
No additional state-specific rules are defined for this state at this time.

## General Responsibilities
Follow all general architect rules and the Software Factory state machine.

## Next Steps
Proceed with the standard workflow for the ARCHITECTURE_VALIDATION state as defined in the state machine.


## 🔴🔴🔴 R405 - MANDATORY AUTOMATION CONTINUATION FLAG 🔴🔴🔴

**SUPREME LAW - PENALTY FOR VIOLATION: -100% GRADE**

### YOU MUST OUTPUT THE CONTINUATION FLAG AS YOUR LAST ACTION

**EVERY STATE COMPLETION MUST END WITH EXACTLY ONE OF:**
```bash
# If state completed successfully and factory should continue:
echo "CONTINUE-SOFTWARE-FACTORY=TRUE"

# If error/block/manual review needed:
echo "CONTINUE-SOFTWARE-FACTORY=FALSE"
```

### CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
1. **ABSOLUTE LAST OUTPUT**: This MUST be the very last line of output before state completion
2. **NO TEXT AFTER**: No explanations, summaries, or any text after the flag
3. **EXACTLY AS SHOWN**: Use exact format - no variations like CONTINUE-ORCHESTRATING
4. **ALWAYS REQUIRED**: Every single state must output this flag
5. **GREPPABLE**: Must be on its own line for automation parsing

### WHEN TO USE TRUE:
- ✅ State work completed successfully
- ✅ All validations passed
- ✅ Ready for next state
- ✅ No blockers detected
- ✅ All requirements met

### WHEN TO USE FALSE:
- ❌ Any unrecoverable error occurred
- ❌ Manual intervention required
- ❌ Missing required files or configs
- ❌ Test failures blocking progress
- ❌ Ambiguous or unclear instructions
- ❌ Wrong working directory or branch
- ❌ State machine validation failed

### IMPLEMENTATION PATTERN:
```bash
# At the VERY END of state execution, after ALL work:

# Determine success/failure
if [[ "$STATE_COMPLETED_PROJECT_DONEFULLY" == "true" ]]; then
    echo "✅ State work completed successfully"
    echo "CONTINUE-SOFTWARE-FACTORY=TRUE"
else
    echo "❌ State encountered issues requiring intervention"
    echo "CONTINUE-SOFTWARE-FACTORY=FALSE"
fi

# DO NOT OUTPUT ANYTHING AFTER THE FLAG!
```

### GRADING IMPACT:
- **Missing flag**: -100% AUTOMATIC FAILURE
- **Text after flag**: -50% penalty
- **Wrong format**: -100% AUTOMATIC FAILURE
- **Multiple flags**: -50% penalty
