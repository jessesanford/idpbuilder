  - Split 002: Chain validation & X509 utilities (452 lines)
  - Split 003: ChainValidator and comprehensive tests (493 lines)
  - Complete certificate chain validation logic
  - Diagnostic capabilities for troubleshooting

- ✅ E1.2.2: Fallback Strategies (96 lines)
  - Implemented fallback manager with retry logic
  - Created insecure mode handler with warnings
  - System cert and cache strategies
  - 83.8%+ test coverage achieved

## Delivered Features

### Core Certificate Management
- Certificate extraction from Kind clusters
- Automatic Gitea certificate retrieval
- Local certificate storage and caching
- Trust store management with registry isolation

### Validation & Security
- Complete X.509 certificate chain validation
- Multiple validation modes (Strict, Lenient, Insecure)
- Comprehensive error types and diagnostics
- Hostname and key usage verification
- Weak algorithm detection

### Fallback & Recovery
- Priority-based fallback strategy execution
- Exponential backoff retry logic
- System certificate store integration
- Cache-based certificate recovery
- --insecure flag support with clear warnings

## Architecture Decisions

1. **Interface Segregation**: Clean interfaces between packages for loose coupling
2. **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error types with diagnostic information
3. **Security First**: Default to secure, explicit insecure mode with warnings
4. **Testability**: Mock implementations for all external dependencies
5. **Size Management**: Split large efforts to maintain <800 line limit

## Metrics

- **Code Review Success**: 100% (all efforts passed review)
- **Split Compliance**: 100% (E1.2.1 successfully split into 3 parts)
- **Test Coverage**: 
  - pkg/certs: Comprehensive coverage
  - pkg/certvalidation: Extensive test suite
  - pkg/fallback: 83.8% coverage
  - pkg/insecure: 100% coverage
- **Build Status**: ✅ All certificate packages build successfully
- **Test Status**: ✅ All certificate package tests pass

## Integration Status

- **Wave 1 Integration**: ✅ Complete
- **Wave 2 Integration**: ✅ Complete
- **Phase Integration Branch**: Created and pushed
- **Merge Conflicts**: Resolved (IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN.md, work-log.md)
- **Ready for Production**: Pending final review

## Lessons Learned

1. **Size Estimation**: Initial estimates were conservative; actual implementation varied
2. **Split Strategy**: Breaking large efforts into splits worked well
3. **Parallel Development**: Wave 2 efforts successfully developed in parallel
4. **Interface Design**: Clean interfaces enabled smooth integration
5. **Test Coverage**: High coverage caught issues early

## Next Steps

### Phase 2: Build & Push Implementation
Phase 2 will build upon the certificate infrastructure created in Phase 1:

- **Wave 1**: Core Build & Push
  - E2.1.1: go-containerregistry image builder (600 lines)
  - E2.1.2: Gitea registry client (600 lines)

- **Wave 2**: CLI Integration
  - E2.2.1: Build and push CLI commands (500 lines)

### Immediate Actions
1. Create pull request for phase integration branch
2. Await final architecture review
3. Begin Phase 2 planning and setup
4. Document API for Phase 2 consumption

## Sign-Off

**Phase 1 Status**: COMPLETE ✅

All certificate infrastructure components have been successfully implemented, tested, and integrated. The phase provides a solid foundation for secure OCI operations in Phase 2.
