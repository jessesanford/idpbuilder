R359 SUPREME LAW VIOLATION - FIX COMPLETE
==========================================

Completed at: $(date '+%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S %Z')
Branch: phase1/wave2/registry-authentication-split-001
Split: E1.2.2-registry-authentication-split-001

VIOLATION CORRECTED:
- All 1,528 deleted lines have been RESTORED
- Zero net deletions from parent branch
- Only additions: R359-FIX-PLAN.md (152 lines)

FILES RESTORED:
- pkg/push/auth/* (authenticator, credentials, insecure)
- pkg/push/errors/auth_errors.go
- pkg/push/retry/* (backoff, errors, retry) - 380 lines
- .software-factory/IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN and work-log
- SIZE-LIMIT-EXCEEDED.marker

VERIFICATION:
✅ Lines deleted from parent: 0
✅ Lines added from parent: 152 (R359-FIX-PLAN.md only)
✅ All original code restored
✅ Repository integrity maintained

KEY LEARNING:
- The 800-line limit applies ONLY to NEW code added
- Splits partition NEW work into manageable pieces
- NEVER delete existing code to meet size limits
- Each split ADDS to the existing codebase

NOTE: Pre-existing compilation error in retry.go line 59
(type assertion bug) exists in parent branch. This is
NOT part of R359 fix scope - separate issue to address.

STATUS: R359 COMPLIANCE RESTORED
