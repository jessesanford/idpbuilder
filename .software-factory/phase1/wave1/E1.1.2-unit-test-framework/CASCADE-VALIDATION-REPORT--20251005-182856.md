- ‚úÖ Confirming builds succeed
- ‚úÖ Confirming tests pass
- ‚úÖ Validating demo scripts work

**SKIPPED per R353**:
- ‚è≠Ô∏è Size measurements (CASCADE mode)

## Integration Issue Background

**Issue Identified**: R291 Gate 4 Violation - Missing Demo Scripts
**Root Cause**: Demo script not created during initial implementation
**Required Fix**: Create `demo-features.sh` and `DEMO.md` per R291 requirements

**R291 Requirement (Gate 4)**:
> "EVERY integration at EVERY level (Wave, Phase, Project) MUST produce a working build, automated test harness, and demonstrable functionality before marking integration as complete."

## R291 Compliance Verification

### Gate 4: Demo Verification - NOW PASSING ‚úÖ

**R291 Requirements Met**:
- ‚úÖ Executable demo script created (`demo-features.sh`)
- ‚úÖ Self-contained with setup/cleanup
- ‚úÖ Shows actual functionality working
- ‚úÖ Returns proper exit status (0 on success)
- ‚úÖ Includes documentation (`DEMO.md`)
- ‚úÖ Produces evidence (test output showing 93.3% coverage)
- ‚úÖ Proves implementation delivers value

**Demo Framework Features Demonstrated**:
- Mock OCI registry server for testing
- Test fixtures setup and cleanup
- Mock authentication transport
- Test image creation helpers
- Assertion utilities for push operations

**Value Proposition**: "This framework enables TDD for OCI registry push operations!"

## Git Status

**Branch**: `idpbuilder-push-oci/phase1/wave1/unit-test-framework`
**Commits Ahead**: 5 commits ahead of base
**Clean Status**: Yes (only test artifacts uncommitted)

**Uncommitted Files** (non-blocking):
- `coverage.out` (test coverage output - safe to ignore)

## Recommendations for Integration Agent

### Next Steps:
1. ‚úÖ Re-merge this effort branch into integration workspace
2. ‚úÖ Re-run R291 Gate 4 checks in integration context
3. ‚úÖ Verify all P1W1 efforts now have passing demos
4. ‚úÖ Proceed with Wave 1 integration completion

### Integration Commands:
```bash
# In integration workspace:
cd /path/to/integration/workspace
git merge origin/idpbuilder-push-oci/phase1/wave1/unit-test-framework

# Run R291 Gate 4 verification
./demo-features.sh  # Should exit 0

# Verify all gates pass
run_r291_gates
```
