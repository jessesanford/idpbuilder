# Effort Implementation Plan: E1.1.1 - Analyze existing idpbuilder structure

## 🚨 CRITICAL EFFORT METADATA (FROM WAVE PLAN)
**Effort**: E1.1.1 - Analyze existing idpbuilder structure
**Branch**: `phase1/wave1/analyze-existing-structure`
**Base Branch**: `main`
**Base Branch Reason**: First effort in Phase 1, Wave 1 - starts from main branch per R308 incremental strategy
**Can Parallelize**: No
**Parallel With**: None - This is the first effort and blocks others
**Size Estimate**: 0 lines (analysis-only effort, no code changes)
**Dependencies**: None (first effort in wave)
**Dependent Efforts**: E1.1.2 (unit test framework), E1.1.3 (integration test setup)
**Atomic PR**: ✅ This effort = ONE PR to main (R220 REQUIREMENT)

## 📋 Source Information
**Wave Plan**: From PROJECT-IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN.md Phase 1, Wave 1
**Effort Section**: Effort E1.1.1
**Created By**: Code Reviewer Agent
**Date**: 2025-09-29
**Extracted**: 2025-09-29T05:19:20Z

## 🔴 BASE BRANCH VALIDATION (R337 MANDATORY)
**The orchestrator-state.json is the SOLE SOURCE OF TRUTH for base branches!**
- Base branch MUST be explicitly specified above: `main`
- Base branch MUST match what's in orchestrator-state.json
- Reason MUST explain why this base: First effort of Phase 1, Wave 1 always starts from main
- Orchestrator MUST record this in state file before creating infrastructure

## 🚀 Parallelization Context
**Can Parallelize**: No
**Parallel With**: None
**Blocking Status**: This effort blocks E1.1.2 and E1.1.3
**Parallel Group**: N/A (standalone)
**Orchestrator Guidance**: Must complete before spawning other Wave 1 efforts

## 🚨 EXPLICIT SCOPE DEFINITION (R311 MANDATORY)

### IMPLEMENT EXACTLY (BE SPECIFIC!)

This is an **ANALYSIS-ONLY** effort. No code implementation required.

#### Documentation to Create (EXACTLY 1 file)
```
1. ANALYSIS-REPORT.md    // ~200-300 lines - Comprehensive analysis document
// STOP HERE - DO NOT CREATE MORE FILES
```

#### Analysis Tasks to Complete (EXACTLY 7 tasks)
```
1. Analyze command structure patterns in pkg/cmd/
2. Identify Go version and key dependencies from go.mod
3. Document testing patterns in tests/ and pkg/*_test.go files
4. Locate appropriate package structure for push command
5. Understand CLI framework usage (Cobra)
6. Document build system (Makefile) patterns
7. Identify authentication/credential patterns if any exist
```

### 🛑 DO NOT IMPLEMENT (SCOPE BOUNDARIES)

**EXPLICITLY FORBIDDEN IN THIS EFFORT:**
- ❌ DO NOT write any Go code

```

## 🔴🔴🔴 PRE-PLANNING RESEARCH RESULTS (R374 MANDATORY) 🔴🔴🔴

### Existing Interfaces Found
| Interface | Location | Signature | Must Implement |
|-----------|----------|-----------|----------------|
| N/A - Analysis phase | N/A | N/A | NO |

### Existing Implementations to Reuse
| Component | Location | Purpose | How to Use |
|-----------|----------|---------|------------|
| Cobra commands | pkg/cmd/ | CLI structure | Study patterns for push command |
| Test helpers | tests/e2e/ | Integration testing | Understand test patterns |

### APIs Already Defined
| API | Method | Signature | Notes |
|-----|--------|-----------|-------|
| Will be discovered during analysis | TBD | TBD | Document in ANALYSIS-REPORT.md |

### FORBIDDEN DUPLICATIONS (R373)
- ❌ DO NOT create any new commands in this effort
- ❌ DO NOT duplicate existing patterns (study only)

### REQUIRED INTEGRATIONS (R373)
- ✅ MUST analyze existing command patterns
- ✅ MUST understand current testing approach
- ✅ MUST document findings for future efforts

## 📁 Files to Create

### Primary Implementation Files
```yaml
new_files:

    lines: ~250
    purpose: Document comprehensive analysis of idpbuilder structure
    contains:
      - Command structure patterns
      - Dependencies analysis
      - Testing patterns
      - Package organization recommendations
      - Build system understanding
```

### Test Files
```yaml
test_files: []  # No test files in analysis effort
```

## 📦 Files to Import/Reuse

### From Previous Efforts (This Wave)
```yaml
this_wave_imports: []  # First effort, no previous work
```

```yaml
previous_work_imports: []  # First wave, no previous work
```

## 🔗 Dependencies

### Effort Dependencies

## 🔴 ATOMIC PR REQUIREMENTS (R220 - SUPREME LAW)

### 🔴🔴🔴 PARAMOUNT: Independent Mergeability (R307) 🔴🔴🔴
**This effort MUST be mergeable at ANY time, even YEARS later:**
- ✅ Must compile when merged alone to main (no code changes)
- ✅ Must NOT break any existing functionality (analysis only)
- ✅ Must use feature flags for incomplete features (N/A)
- ✅ Must work even if next effort merges 6 months later
- ✅ Must gracefully degrade if dependencies missing (N/A)

### Feature Flags for This Effort
```yaml
feature_flags: []  # No feature flags needed for analysis
```

### 🚨🚨🚨 R355 PRODUCTION READY CODE (SUPREME LAW #5) 🚨🚨🚨

**ALL CODE MUST BE PRODUCTION READY - NO EXCEPTIONS**

This is an analysis-only effort with no code implementation.

### PR Mergeability Checklist
- [x] PR can merge to main independently
- [x] Build passes with just this PR (no code changes)
- [x] All tests pass in isolation (no new tests)
- [x] Feature flags hide incomplete features (N/A)
- [x] Stubs replace missing dependencies (N/A)

4. **Size Limit**: Must remain at 0 lines of code
5. **Dependencies**: Document but don't implement
6. **Test Coverage**: No tests in analysis phase
7. **Isolation**: Stay in effort directory
8. **Parallelization**: Complete quickly to unblock others

### Success Criteria Checklist
- [ ] Read and acknowledged DO NOT IMPLEMENT section
- [ ] Created EXACTLY 1 document (ANALYSIS-REPORT.md)
- [ ] Made EXACTLY 0 code changes
- [ ] Completed EXACTLY 7 analysis tasks
- [ ] NO code files created
- [ ] NO test files created
