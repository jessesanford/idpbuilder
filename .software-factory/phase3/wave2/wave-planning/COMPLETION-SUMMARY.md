# WAVE PLANNING EFFORT - COMPLETION SUMMARY

## Effort Completion Status: ✅ COMPLETE

**Effort**: wave-planning (Phase 3, Wave 2)
**Completed**: 2025-09-25T17:46:00Z
**Branch**: `idpbuilderpush/phase3/wave2/wave-planning`
**Commit**: 81c1d40

## Deliverables Completed

All required planning documents have been created and stored in the `.software-factory` directory per R303:

### 1. ✅ Implementation Plan
**File**: `IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN-20250925-174029.md`
**Purpose**: Master plan for the wave-planning effort
**Status**: COMPLETE

### 2. ✅ Wave 3.2 Execution Plan
**File**: `WAVE-3.2-EXECUTION-PLAN.md`
**Purpose**: Detailed execution strategy for Wave 3.2
**Key Points**:
- Sequential execution required (TDD)
- 2-day timeline
- Clear success criteria

### 3. ✅ Effort Dependencies
**File**: `EFFORT-DEPENDENCIES.md`
**Purpose**: Maps all internal and external dependencies
**Key Points**:
- 3.2.1 blocks 3.2.2 (TDD requirement)
- Wave 3.1 dependencies satisfied
- Library versions locked per R381

### 4. ✅ Parallelization Analysis
**File**: `PARALLELIZATION-ANALYSIS.md`
**Purpose**: Analysis of parallelization opportunities
**Key Decision**: NO PARALLELIZATION POSSIBLE
- TDD requires sequential execution
- Tests must exist before implementation

### 5. ✅ Integration Checkpoints
**File**: `INTEGRATION-CHECKPOINTS.md`
**Purpose**: Quality gates throughout execution
**Key Points**:
- 14 checkpoints defined
- Clear validation criteria
- Failure recovery procedures

### 6. ✅ Coordination Timeline
**File**: `COORDINATION-TIMELINE.md`
**Purpose**: Hour-by-hour execution timeline
**Key Points**:
- Day 1: Test development + review
- Day 2: Implementation + integration
- Critical synchronization points defined

### 7. ✅ Test Strategy
**File**: `TEST-STRATEGY.md`
**Purpose**: Comprehensive testing approach
**Key Points**:
- 85% coverage requirement
- TDD three-phase approach (RED-GREEN-REFACTOR)
- 10 test scenarios defined

## Key Decisions Made

1. **No Parallelization**: Wave 3.2 must execute sequentially due to TDD
2. **2-Day Timeline**: Realistic schedule with buffers
3. **85% Coverage**: Minimum test coverage requirement
4. **Sequential Reviews**: Each effort reviewed before next starts

## Next Steps for Orchestrator

1. **Read Planning Documents**: Review all created plans
2. **Spawn Effort 3.2.1**: Create infrastructure and spawn Software Engineer for tests
3. **Enforce Sequencing**: Do not start 3.2.2 until 3.2.1 complete and reviewed
4. **Monitor Progress**: Use timeline and checkpoints for tracking

## Compliance Summary

✅ **R303 Compliance**: Plans stored in .software-factory directory
✅ **R301 Compliance**: Timestamped implementation plan
✅ **R211 Compliance**: Parallelization clearly specified (None)
✅ **R381 Compliance**: Library versions documented as immutable
