```

### Checkpoint 9: Integration Branch Creation
**When**: Start of Integration
**Purpose**: Create clean integration environment

**Steps**:
1. Create integration branch from Wave 3.1 integration
2. Verify clean working state
3. Prepare for effort merges

**Commands**:
```bash
git checkout -b idpbuilderpush/phase3/wave2/integration \
    idpbuilderpush/phase3/wave1/integration
git status
make test # Baseline test
```

### Checkpoint 10: Sequential Merge

4. **Level 4**: Architect consultation

## Checkpoint Monitoring

### Automated Monitoring
```yaml
monitoring:
  test_status:
    command: "go test ./pkg/oci/..."
    frequency: "after_each_commit"
    alert_on: "failure"

  coverage:
    command: "go test -cover ./pkg/oci/..."
    threshold: 85
    alert_on: "below_threshold"

  build_status:
    command: "make build"
    frequency: "after_each_merge"
    alert_on: "failure"
```
