# WAVE 3.2 EXECUTION PLAN - Push Operation Implementation

## Executive Summary

Wave 3.2 delivers the core push functionality for idpbuilder-push, implementing the complete image upload workflow to OCI-compliant registries. This wave follows strict Test-Driven Development (TDD) methodology with sequential execution of test creation followed by implementation.

## Wave Overview

- **Wave**: Phase 3, Wave 2
- **Theme**: Push Operation Implementation
- **Total Size**: 600 LOC (implementation only, excludes tests)
- **Duration**: 2 days
- **Execution Model**: STRICTLY SEQUENTIAL (TDD requirement)
- **Dependencies**: Wave 3.1 OCI Client (COMPLETED)

## TDD Enforcement

### Mandatory TDD Cycle
1. **RED Phase** (Effort 3.2.1): Write failing tests FIRST
2. **GREEN Phase** (Effort 3.2.2): Minimal implementation to pass tests
3. **REFACTOR Phase** (Effort 3.2.2): Optimize while maintaining green

### Evidence Requirements
- Git history MUST show tests committed before implementation
- Test files timestamped before implementation files
- Coverage reports demonstrate test completeness (≥85%)

## Effort Execution Sequence

### Effort 3.2.1: Push Operation Tests
**Execution Order**: FIRST (Day 1, Morning)
**Size**: 200 LOC
**Type**: Test Development (TDD RED Phase)
**Blocking**: YES - Blocks Effort 3.2.2

**Objectives**:
- Create comprehensive push operation test suite
- Define expected behaviors through tests
- Establish test fixtures and data
- Set up test infrastructure

**Deliverables**:
- `pkg/oci/push_test.go` - Push operation tests
- `pkg/oci/testdata/images/` - Test image fixtures
- All tests MUST fail initially (RED phase)

**Success Criteria**:
- ✅ Tests cover all push scenarios
- ✅ Tests are comprehensive and clear
- ✅ Tests fail appropriately (no false positives)
- ✅ Test data properly structured

### Effort 3.2.2: Implement Push
**Execution Order**: SECOND (Day 1 Afternoon - Day 2)
**Size**: 400 LOC
**Type**: Implementation (TDD GREEN-REFACTOR)
**Dependency**: Effort 3.2.1 MUST be complete

**Objectives**:
- Implement PushOperation interface
- Create progress reporting mechanism
- Add image validation logic
- Make all tests pass (GREEN phase)
- Optimize implementation (REFACTOR phase)

**Deliverables**:
- `pkg/oci/push.go` - Push operation implementation
- `pkg/oci/progress.go` - Progress reporting
- `pkg/oci/validation.go` - Image validation
- All tests MUST pass (GREEN phase)

**Success Criteria**:
- ✅ All Effort 3.2.1 tests passing
- ✅ Code coverage ≥85%
- ✅ Performance within specifications
- ✅ Clean, maintainable code

## Execution Timeline

### Day 1 (8 hours)
**Morning (4 hours)**:
- 09:00-10:00: Effort 3.2.1 infrastructure setup
- 10:00-12:00: Write push operation tests
- 12:00-13:00: Complete test fixtures

**Afternoon (4 hours)**:
- 14:00-15:00: Review and commit tests (3.2.1 complete)
- 15:00-17:00: Begin Effort 3.2.2 implementation
- 17:00-18:00: Initial push.go development

### Day 2 (8 hours)
**Morning (4 hours)**:
- 09:00-11:00: Complete push implementation
- 11:00-12:00: Add progress reporting
- 12:00-13:00: Implement validation logic

**Afternoon (4 hours)**:
- 14:00-15:00: Ensure all tests pass (GREEN)
- 15:00-16:00: Refactor and optimize
- 16:00-17:00: Final testing and documentation
- 17:00-18:00: Wave integration preparation

## Critical Constraints

### No Parallelization Allowed
**Reason**: TDD requires tests before implementation
- Effort 3.2.1 MUST complete before 3.2.2 starts
- No concurrent development permitted
- Sequential review cycles required

### Dependency Requirements
**From Wave 3.1** (ALL COMPLETED):
- ✅ Registry client implementation
- ✅ Transport configuration
- ✅ Authentication integration
- ✅ Connection management

**From Phase 2** (ALL COMPLETED):
- ✅ Authentication system
- ✅ Credential management
- ✅ Token refresh mechanism

### Library Version Lock (R381)
```go
// IMMUTABLE - Do NOT update versions
github.com/google/go-containerregistry v0.20.2
github.com/spf13/cobra v1.8.0
github.com/go-logr/logr v1.3.0
```

## Quality Gates

### Effort 3.2.1 Completion Gate
Before marking complete:
- [ ] All test scenarios covered
- [ ] Test fixtures properly created
- [ ] Tests fail appropriately
- [ ] Code committed and pushed
- [ ] Review completed

### Effort 3.2.2 Completion Gate
Before marking complete:
- [ ] All tests passing (100%)
- [ ] Coverage ≥85%
- [ ] No memory leaks
- [ ] Performance validated
- [ ] Code review passed

### Wave 3.2 Completion Gate
Before wave integration:
- [ ] Both efforts complete
- [ ] All tests passing
- [ ] Integration tests written
- [ ] Documentation complete
- [ ] Ready for Phase 3 integration

## Risk Management

### Technical Risks
1. **Large Image Handling**
   - Risk: Memory exhaustion
   - Mitigation: Streaming implementation required
   - Validation: Test with 5GB+ images

2. **Network Failures**
   - Risk: Incomplete uploads
   - Mitigation: Retry logic implementation
   - Validation: Chaos testing

3. **Registry Compatibility**
   - Risk: Different registry behaviors
   - Mitigation: Test multiple implementations
   - Validation: Docker Hub, Harbor, Quay tests

### Schedule Risks
1. **Test Complexity**
   - Risk: 3.2.1 takes longer than estimated
   - Mitigation: Start early Day 1
   - Contingency: Extend to Day 2 morning

2. **Implementation Challenges**
   - Risk: 3.2.2 complexity underestimated
   - Mitigation: Leverage go-containerregistry
   - Contingency: Focus on core functionality

# Push with authentication
idpbuilder push --username admin --password secret \
    myimage.tar registry.example.com/myimage:latest

# Push to insecure registry
idpbuilder push --insecure \
    myimage.tar localhost:5000/myimage:latest

# Push with progress reporting
idpbuilder push --progress \
    large-image.tar registry.example.com/large:latest
```
