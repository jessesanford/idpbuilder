# Work Log - Mock Auth for Testing

## Effort: 2.1.3 - Mock Auth for Testing
**Phase**: 2 (Authentication & Credentials)
**Wave**: 1 (Credential Management with TDD)
**TDD Phase**: REFACTOR (Test Infrastructure)

## Planning Phase

### 2025-09-23 16:01:49 UTC - Initial Planning
- Started effort planning for Mock Auth for Testing
- Analyzed project structure and existing authentication patterns
- Identified need for mock infrastructure around Git authentication and credentials
- Discovered existing patterns in gitrepository controller using gitea SDK

### Context Analysis
- Project uses Git-based authentication with Gitea
- Existing code uses go-git for Git operations
- Authentication through HTTP with username/password or tokens
- Need mocks for both authentication and secret management

### Plan Created
- Designed three-part mock infrastructure:
  1. Mock Authenticator (80 lines) - Main authentication mock
  2. Test Helpers (70 lines) - Utility functions and fixtures
  3. Secret Manager Mock (50 lines) - Mock secret storage
- Total: 200 lines (exactly at target)
- Focus on reusability and test isolation

## Implementation Tasks

### TODO: Mock Authenticator (pkg/oci/auth_mock.go)
- [ ] Create MockAuthenticator struct with configurable behavior
- [ ] Implement authentication interface methods
- [ ] Add call tracking for test verification
- [ ] Create MockCredential type
- [ ] Add error injection capabilities
- [ ] Implement reset method for test isolation

### TODO: Test Helpers (pkg/oci/testutil/helpers.go)
- [ ] Create test fixture builder with options pattern
- [ ] Implement assertion helper functions
- [ ] Add test data generators (credentials, tokens)
- [ ] Create integration test setup helpers
- [ ] Add cleanup utilities
- [ ] Document usage patterns

### TODO: Secret Manager Mock (pkg/oci/secrets_mock.go)
- [ ] Create MockSecretManager with in-memory store
- [ ] Implement secret CRUD operations
- [ ] Add access logging for verification
- [ ] Implement failure simulation
- [ ] Add test scenario helpers
- [ ] Ensure thread-safety for parallel tests

### TODO: Testing & Documentation
- [ ] Write tests for the mock infrastructure itself
- [ ] Add comprehensive godoc comments
- [ ] Create usage examples
- [ ] Document configuration options
- [ ] Add troubleshooting guide

## Design Decisions

### Options Pattern for Configuration
- Chose options pattern for mock configuration to provide flexibility
- Allows easy extension without breaking existing tests
- Enables fluent API for test setup

### Separation of Concerns
- Separate mocks from helpers to avoid circular dependencies
- Keep test utilities in `testutil` package
- Export all types for cross-package usage

### Thread Safety
- All mocks will be thread-safe for parallel test execution
- Use sync.Mutex for shared state protection
- No global variables or singletons

## Notes
- This is REFACTOR phase - creating test infrastructure only
- No production code in this effort
- Focus on making mocks reusable across all test suites
- Coordinates with auth-interface-tests and auth-implementation efforts
