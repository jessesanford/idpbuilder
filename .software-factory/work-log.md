# E1.2.2 Registry Authentication - Work Log

## [2025-09-29 14:50] Implementation Started
- Started implementation of registry authentication modules
- Created directory structure: pkg/push/auth, pkg/push/retry, pkg/push/errors

## [2025-09-29 14:51] Core Modules Implemented
- Files implemented:
  - pkg/push/auth/authenticator.go - Main authentication logic (122 lines)
  - pkg/push/auth/credentials.go - Credential handling with precedence (130 lines)
  - pkg/push/auth/insecure.go - Insecure transport support (75 lines)
  - pkg/push/retry/backoff.go - Exponential backoff strategy (126 lines)
  - pkg/push/retry/retry.go - Retry wrapper with context support (185 lines)
  - pkg/push/retry/errors.go - Retry validation errors (8 lines)
  - pkg/push/errors/auth_errors.go - Authentication error types (126 lines)

## [2025-09-29 14:52] Size Limit Exceeded - Implementation Stopped
- Total implementation: 872 lines (EXCEEDS 800-line limit)
- Violation: Hard limit exceeded by 72 lines
- Final commit: 4dd558a marker: size limit exceeded - requires split for unit tests
- Status: STOPPED per R220 - no further work allowed

## Implementation Summary
✅ COMPLETED:
- Authentication module structure with options pattern
- Credential handling with proper precedence (flags > env > keychain)
- Insecure mode support for self-signed certificates
- Exponential backoff retry logic with jitter and context support
- Comprehensive error types for authentication, retry, and registry failures
- All modules follow go-containerregistry patterns
- Clean commit history with descriptive messages

❌ PENDING (Requires Split):
- Unit tests for auth module (~150 lines estimated)
- Unit tests for retry module (~100 lines estimated)
- Integration tests for end-to-end flows

## Technical Achievements
- Proper credential precedence implementation
- Context-aware retry logic with exponential backoff
- Comprehensive error handling with retry classification
- Insecure transport support for development/testing
- Clean separation of concerns across modules
- Following Go idioms and go-containerregistry patterns

## Next Steps (For Split Branch)
1. Code Reviewer must create split plan for unit tests
2. Implement comprehensive unit tests in split branch
3. Achieve >85% test coverage as required
4. Integration testing with mock registry

## Performance Notes
- Retry delays capped at 30 seconds maximum
- Total retry time won't exceed ~5 minutes with default strategy
- Jitter applied to prevent thundering herd
- Context cancellation support throughout
