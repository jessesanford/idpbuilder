## Pre-Integration Setup
### Operation 1: Verified workspace location
Command: cd /home/vscode/workspaces/idpbuilder-push/efforts/phase1/wave1/integration-workspace && pwd
Result: Success - Confirmed in correct workspace

### Operation 2: Checked git status
Command: git status
Result: Clean workspace on branch phase1/wave1/integration

### Operation 3: Read merge plan
Command: Read MERGE-PLAN.md
Result: Success - Understood merge strategy and conflict resolution plan

### Operation 4: Created documentation structure
Command: mkdir -p .software-factory
Result: Success - Documentation directory created

## Pre-Merge Validation Steps
### Operation 5: Fetch all effort branches
Command: git fetch origin idpbuilderpush/phase1/wave1/command-tests:idpbuilderpush/phase1/wave1/command-tests
Result: Success - Fetched effort 1.1.1

Command: git fetch origin idpbuilderpush/phase1/wave1/command-skeleton:idpbuilderpush/phase1/wave1/command-skeleton
Result: Success - Fetched effort 1.1.2

Command: git fetch origin idpbuilderpush/phase1/wave1/integration-tests:idpbuilderpush/phase1/wave1/integration-tests
Result: Success - Fetched effort 1.1.3

### Operation 6: Create backup tag
Command: git tag phase1-wave1-pre-integration-$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S)
Result: Success - Created tag phase1-wave1-pre-integration-20250923-152457

## Merge Operations
### Merge 1: Effort 1.1.1 (command-tests)
Command: git merge --no-ff idpbuilderpush/phase1/wave1/command-tests -m "feat(phase1/wave1): integrate effort 1.1.1 - write command tests"
Result: Success - No conflicts
MERGED: idpbuilderpush/phase1/wave1/command-tests at 2025-09-23 15:26:00
Files added: cmd/push/root_test.go, EFFORT-PLAN.md, IMPLEMENTATION-COMPLETE.marker, work-log.md

### Test Run After Merge 1
Command: go test ./cmd/push/... -v
Result: Build failed - Expected (tests reference pushCmd which comes from effort 1.1.2)
Note: This is expected behavior - tests written before implementation

### Merge 2: Effort 1.1.2 (command-skeleton)
Command: git merge --no-ff idpbuilderpush/phase1/wave1/command-skeleton -m "feat(phase1/wave1): integrate effort 1.1.2 - command skeleton"
Result: Conflicts occurred as expected
MERGED: idpbuilderpush/phase1/wave1/command-skeleton at 2025-09-23 15:29:00
Conflicts resolved in:
- cmd/push/root_test.go (kept all test functions, removed duplicate PushConfig struct)
- IMPLEMENTATION-COMPLETE.marker (combined both efforts' completion info)
- work-log.md (combined work logs from both efforts)
- .software-factory/work-log.md (kept integration work log)

### Test Run After Merge 2
Command: go build ./cmd/push/...
Result: Success - Build passes

Command: go test ./cmd/push/... -v
Result: Success - All 7 tests passing

### Merge 3: Effort 1.1.3 (integration-tests)
Command: git merge --no-ff idpbuilderpush/phase1/wave1/integration-tests -m "feat(phase1/wave1): integrate effort 1.1.3 - integration tests"
Result: Conflicts occurred as expected
MERGED: idpbuilderpush/phase1/wave1/integration-tests at 2025-09-23 15:32:00
Conflicts resolved in:
- cmd/push/config.go (kept RegistryURL field from 1.1.2 as per plan)
- IMPLEMENTATION-COMPLETE.marker (combined all three efforts' completion info)
- work-log.md (combined work logs from all efforts)

### Post-Integration Validation
Command: go build ./cmd/push/...
Result: Success - Build passes

Command: go test (unit tests only)
Result: Success - All 7 unit tests passing
Note: Integration tests have expected failures due to missing parent command wiring

Command: go build -o idpbuilder-push ./main.go
Result: Success - Binary builds correctly
