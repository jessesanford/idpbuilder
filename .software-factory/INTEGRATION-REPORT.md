## Efforts Successfully Integrated

### E1.1.1 - Analyze Existing Structure
- **Lines**: 29 (documentation only)
- **Merge Status**: ✅ Complete with conflict resolution
- **Conflicts**: Work logs and completion markers (resolved by merging sections)
- **Key Files**: .software-factory/ANALYSIS-REPORT.md

### E1.1.2-split-001 - Mock Registry Infrastructure
- **Lines**: 660
- **Merge Status**: ✅ Complete with conflict resolution
- **Conflicts**: Work log (resolved by merging)
- **Key Files**: pkg/testutils/mock_registry.go, test_helpers.go

### E1.1.2-split-002 - Test Utilities and Assertions
- **Lines**: 802
- **Merge Status**: ✅ Complete with conflict resolution
- **Conflicts**: Test files (resolved by accepting split-002 versions)
- **Key Files**: pkg/testutils/assertions.go (extended test utilities)

### E1.1.3 - Integration Test Setup

- **Merge Status**: ✅ Complete with conflict resolution
- **Conflicts**: Multiple (work logs, markers, dependencies)
- **Key Files**: pkg/integration/*.go (5 files)
- **Dependencies Added**: testcontainers-go v0.39.0

## Total Implementation
- **Total Lines**: ~2,103 lines
- **Within Limits**: ✅ Yes (well under 2,500 line wave limit)

## Build Results
**Status**: ❌ FAILED (Upstream bugs documented per R266)

### Upstream Bugs Found (NOT FIXED - Per R266)

1. **Duplicate Declaration Bug**:
   - **File**: pkg/cmd/push/root.go:13:5
   - **Issue**: PushCmd redeclared (also in push.go:18:5)
   - **Recommendation**: Remove duplicate declaration in one file
   - **STATUS**: NOT FIXED (upstream issue)

2. **MockRegistry Method Access Issues**:
   - **File**: pkg/testutils/assertions.go
   - **Issues**:
     - Line 48: HasImage method missing (MockRegistry)
     - Line 53: GetImage method missing (MockRegistry)
     - Line 92: AuthConfig should be authConfig (field visibility)
     - Line 119: GetManifest should be getManifest (method visibility)
     - Line 210: Server should be server (field visibility)
   - **Recommendation**: Update method/field visibility in MockRegistry
   - **STATUS**: NOT FIXED (upstream issue)

## Test Results
**Status**: ⏸️ BLOCKED by build failures
- Cannot run tests until build issues are resolved
- Test infrastructure is in place once builds pass

## Dependency Management
### Version Consistency (R381 Compliance)
- ✅ Maintained base versions during conflict resolution
- ✅ Added only new dependencies (testcontainers)
- ✅ No library version updates performed
- Note: go mod tidy adjusted some versions for compatibility

## Integration Process Compliance

### Rules Followed
- ✅ R260 - Integration Agent Core Requirements
- ✅ R261 - Integration Planning Requirements (followed WAVE-MERGE-PLAN.md)
- ✅ R262 - Merge Operation Protocols (never modified originals)
- ✅ R263 - Integration Documentation Requirements (this report)
- ✅ R264 - Work Log Tracking Requirements (detailed work log maintained)
- ✅ R265 - Integration Testing Requirements (attempted, blocked by build)
- ✅ R266 - Upstream Bug Documentation (bugs documented, not fixed)
- ✅ R306 - Merge Ordering with Splits Protocol (correct sequence)
- ✅ R361 - Integration Conflict Resolution Only (no new code created)
- ✅ R381 - Version Consistency During Integration (maintained base versions)
- ✅ R506 - No Pre-Commit Bypass (all commits proper)

### Integration Sequence
1. E1.1.1 → Complete (foundation)
2. E1.1.2-split-001 → Complete (builds on E1.1.1)
3. E1.1.2-split-002 → Complete (builds on split-001)
4. E1.1.3 → Complete (integrated despite different base)

## Conflict Resolution Summary
- **Total Conflicts**: 10
- **Resolution Strategy**: Union of changes, preserving all content
- **Version Conflicts**: Kept base versions per R381
- **File Structure**: Accepted complete versions from split-002

## Recommendations for Next Steps

1. **Fix Build Issues**: SW Engineers should address the documented bugs:
   - Remove duplicate PushCmd declaration
   - Fix MockRegistry method/field visibility

2. **Run Tests**: Once build passes:
   - Run unit tests: `go test ./pkg/testutils/...`
   - Run integration tests: `go test -tags=integration ./pkg/integration/...`

3. **Create PR**: After successful build and tests:
   - Push integration branch to origin
   - Create PR to main branch
   - Include this report in PR description

## Artifacts Preserved
- ✅ All work logs merged and preserved
- ✅ All implementation markers updated
- ✅ All code from efforts integrated
- ✅ Full commit history maintained (--no-ff)
- ✅ No cherry-picks used
- ✅ Original branches untouched

## Final Status
**INTEGRATION STRUCTURALLY COMPLETE** - All merges successful, conflicts resolved, documentation complete. Build failures are upstream bugs requiring developer fixes.
