6. âœ… E1.2.3-image-push-operations-split-003

## R521 Known Fix Applied: BUG-007

### Issue
PushCmd redeclared in both push.go (E1.2.1) and root.go (Wave 1)

### Wave 1 Fix Guidance
"Delete push.go, keep root.go" - but Wave 1 didn't have flags.go/validation.go

### Wave 2 Adaptation
**Decision**: Delete root.go, keep push.go (OPPOSITE of Wave 1)

**Rationale**:
- push.go contains PushOptions type required by flags.go and validation.go
- push.go integrates with E1.2.1's modular structure
- Deleting push.go would cause BUG-010 (PushOptions missing)
- Deleting root.go preserves all functionality

**Classification**: Conflict resolution per R521 (NOT R266 violation)
**Compliance**: Within R361 limits (simple file deletion, <50 lines)

### Result
âœ… BUG-007 resolved  
âœ… BUG-010 avoided  
âœ… Build passes  

## Build Verification

```bash
$ go build .
# SUCCESS - no output
```

**Status**: âœ… PASS

## R291 Demo Compliance
