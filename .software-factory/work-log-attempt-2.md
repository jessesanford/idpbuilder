## All Merges Complete
All 6 Wave 2 effort branches successfully integrated with BUG-007 fix applied.

## Operation 12: Build Verification (FAILED)
Command: go build .
Result: FAILED
Details: 
  - BUG-007 fix applied successfully (deleted duplicate push.go)
  - NEW BUG DISCOVERED (BUG-010): PushOptions type undefined
  - Issue: flags.go and validation.go reference PushOptions which was in deleted push.go
  - Root Cause: Incomplete BUG-007 fix guidance - didn't account for type dependencies
  - ERROR: pkg/cmd/push/flags.go:57:60: undefined: PushOptions
  - ERROR: pkg/cmd/push/flags.go:58:11: undefined: PushOptions
  - ERROR: pkg/cmd/push/validation.go:10:32: undefined: PushOptions
Timestamp: 2025-10-06 04:24:00 UTC
Status: UPSTREAM BUG - CANNOT FIX (R266/R361 compliance)

## Analysis: BUG-010 Discovery
The BUG-007 fix guidance was based on Wave 1 experience but Wave 2 has different structure:
- Wave 1: push.go was standalone duplicate
- Wave 2: push.go contains PushOptions type used by flags.go and validation.go
- Deleting push.go breaks type references
- This is an UPSTREAM DESIGN ISSUE requiring SW Engineer fix
- Integration Agent CANNOT create new types (R361 violation)

## UPSTREAM BUG DISCOVERED: BUG-010

### Issue: PushOptions Struct Mismatch
**Severity**: CRITICAL - Blocks compilation
**Location**: pkg/cmd/push/
**Root Cause**: Structural incompatibility between E1.2.1 code and interfaces package

### Technical Analysis:
1. **Missing PushOptions Definition**:
   - flags.go and validation.go expect local `PushOptions` type
   - Type was likely defined in deleted push.go (BUG-007 fix)

2. **Struct Incompatibility**:
   - Found PushOptions in pkg/cmd/interfaces/types.go
   - BUT: interfaces.PushOptions has DIFFERENT fields:
     - Has: Source, Destination, Platform, Force (+ embedded CommandOptions)
     - Expected by flags.go: ImageRef, RegistryURL, Repository, Tag, DryRun, Verbose, Insecure
   - Fundamental structural mismatch

3. **Why Integration Agent CANNOT Fix (R361/R266)**:
   - Cannot create new PushOptions struct (new code)
   - Cannot modify interfaces.PushOptions (upstream type)
   - Cannot rewrite flags.go logic (feature modification)
   - Must not exceed 50-line conflict resolution limit
   - This requires SW Engineer architectural fix

### BUG-007 Fix Analysis:
- Wave 1 guidance: "Delete push.go after merging E1.2.1"
- Wave 1 context: push.go was pure duplicate
- Wave 2 reality: push.go contained critical type definitions
- Self-healing guidance was incomplete for Wave 2 structure

### Required Fix (Upstream):
SW Engineers must either:
1. Option A: Define local PushOptions in flags.go matching usage
2. Option B: Rewrite flags.go to use interfaces.PushOptions structure
3. Option C: Keep push.go and resolve duplicate PushCmd differently

### R266/R361 Compliance:
✅ Bug documented, NOT fixed
✅ No new code created
✅ No upstream types modified
✅ Integration agent stayed within conflict resolution scope

Status: BUILD_GATE_FAILURE - Requires upstream fix
