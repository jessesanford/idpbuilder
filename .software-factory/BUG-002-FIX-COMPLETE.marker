Bug ID: BUG-cascade-20251005-013208-002
Cascade ID: cascade-20251005-013208
Completed at: $(date '+%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S %Z')
Effort: E1.2.3-split-002
Branch: idpbuilder-push-oci/phase1/wave2/image-push-operations-split-002
Severity: HIGH

Fix Summary:
- Removed duplicate ProgressReporter interface from pusher.go
- Interface now sourced from progress.go (split-001)
- 15 lines deleted from pusher.go

Commit: e4e3e95
Status: FIX COMPLETE

Validation:
- No ProgressReporter interface definition in split-002
- pusher.go still references ProgressReporter (usage preserved)
- Build in isolation fails (expected - missing split-001 dependency)
- Integration build will succeed once cascade completes

Next Step: Integration agent will verify fix in Wave 2 integration workspace
