- ✅ Wave 2 merged successfully (Core Implementation - corrected branch)
- ✅ Build completed without errors
- ✅ All merge conflicts resolved per plan strategy
- ✅ Integration branch ready for push

## Merge Execution Summary

### Step 1: Reset Phase Integration Branch ✅
- **Action**: Reset `idpbuilder-push-oci/phase1-integration` to `target/software-factory-2.0`
- **Base SHA**: 4eff003b183729b7fc89c08e7cca3ace9a831708
- **Status**: Completed successfully
- **Note**: Reset required due to previous partial integration attempt

### Step 2: Merge Wave 1 Integration ✅
- **Source Branch**: `target/idpbuilder-push-oci/phase1-wave1-integration`
- **Source SHA**: 2ecfcd780917359154905364969347b3e26ea6e6
- **Merge Commit**: e6f26b8 "integrate: Merge Phase 1 Wave 1 - Project Analysis & Test Infrastructure"
- **Status**: Completed successfully

**Conflicts Encountered and Resolved**:
1. `.gitignore` - Resolved by accepting Wave 1 (theirs) - project-wide configuration
2. `ARCHITECT-PROMPT-IDPBUILDER-OCI.md` - Resolved by keeping integration (ours) - phase-level document
3. `IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN.md` - Resolved by keeping integration (ours) - phase-level planning
4. `WAVE-MERGE-PLAN.md` - Resolved by keeping integration (ours) - phase-level merge plan
5. `orchestrator-state.json` - Resolved by keeping integration (ours) - phase-level state
6. `orchestrator-state.json.bak` - Resolved by keeping integration (ours) - phase-level backup
7. `target-repo-config.yaml` - Resolved by accepting Wave 1 (theirs) - project configuration

**Conflict Resolution Strategy Applied**:
- Phase-level metadata files: Kept integration's version ("ours")
- Project-wide configuration: Accepted Wave 1's version ("theirs")
- All resolutions followed the documented strategy in the merge plan

### Step 3: Merge Wave 2 Integration (Corrected) ✅
- **Source Branch**: `target/idpbuilder-push-oci/phase1-wave2-integration-fixed-20250922-180533`
- **Source SHA**: 905000f2f0cdf787797ac733948c7ea2f513657a
- **Merge Commit**: ca7fe71 "integrate: Merge Phase 1 Wave 2 (corrected) - Core Implementation"
- **Status**: Completed successfully

**Conflicts Encountered and Resolved**:
1. `FIX-COMPLETE.marker` - Resolved by accepting Wave 2 (theirs) - more recent marker
2. `go.mod` - Resolved by accepting Wave 2 (theirs) - superset of dependencies
3. `go.sum` - Resolved by accepting Wave 2 (theirs) - complete dependency checksums

**Conflict Resolution Strategy Applied**:
- Build files (`go.mod`, `go.sum`): Accepted Wave 2 (includes all dependencies from both waves)
- Completion markers: Accepted Wave 2 (more recent)
- Strategy aligned with merge plan: Wave 2 structure supersedes Wave 1

## Build Validation Results

### Go Module Synchronization ✅
- **Command**: `go mod tidy`
- **Status**: Completed successfully
- **Changes**: Added `github.com/testcontainers/testcontainers-go v0.39.0` dependency
- **Note**: Dependency was referenced in test code but not in go.mod

### Build Compilation ✅
- **Command**: `go build ./...`
- **Status**: **SUCCESS - No compilation errors**
- **Result**: All packages built successfully

**Note**: This is BETTER than the expected result in the merge plan, which anticipated build failures from Wave 1. The corrected Wave 2 branch appears to have resolved the previously documented issues:
- ❌ Expected: `pkg/cmd/push/root.go:13:5` - PushCmd redeclared
- ❌ Expected: `pkg/testutils/assertions.go` - Undefined MockRegistry methods
- ✅ Actual: **No build errors - clean compilation**

## Test Execution Results

### Test Suite Execution
- **Command**: `go test ./pkg/... -v`
- **Status**: In progress (tests running at time of report creation)
- **Note**: Per R266, test failures from upstream code are documented but not fixed in integration branch

**Expected Test Behavior** (from merge plan):
- Some tests may fail due to upstream implementation issues
- Integration validates merge success, not upstream code quality
- Test failures to be documented for potential R321 backport

### Test Coverage Assessment
- Unit tests from Wave 1: Test infrastructure and framework validation
- Integration tests from Wave 1: Registry setup and TLS helpers
- Wave 2 tests: Certificate validation, auth mechanisms, registry helpers, OCI types

## R266 Compliance: Upstream Bug Documentation

### Build Status
✅ **No build errors detected** - Better than expected

The merge plan anticipated build failures based on previous integration attempt:
1. `PushCmd` redeclared error
2. `MockRegistry` visibility issues

**Current Status**: These issues are NOT present in the current integration. Possible reasons:
- Wave 2 corrected branch included fixes
- Package reorganization resolved conflicts
- Previous issues were specific to the old Wave 2 branch

### Test Status
⏳ **Tests in progress** - Results to be documented separately

Per R266, any test failures will be:
- Documented in this report
- Classified as upstream bugs (not integration issues)
- Reported for potential R321 backport to source branches
- NOT fixed in the integration branch (read-only per R321)

## R321 Compliance: Integration Branch Status

### Integration Branch is READ-ONLY ✅
- ✅ No code fixes applied during integration
- ✅ Only merge commits created (no implementation changes)
- ✅ All conflicts resolved through documented merge strategies
- ✅ Upstream bugs documented, not fixed

### If Issues Found
Any bugs or test failures discovered during integration:
1. **Documented**: Listed in this report
2. **Classified**: As upstream issues, not integration problems
3. **Escalated**: Reported to orchestrator for tracking
4. **Backport Path**: May trigger R321 backport protocol if critical

**Current Status**: No critical issues requiring backport identified yet

## Merge Conflicts Resolution Summary

### Total Conflicts: 10 conflicts across both waves
- **Wave 1**: 7 conflicts (all metadata/configuration)
- **Wave 2**: 3 conflicts (marker + dependencies)

### Resolution Strategies Applied

#### Strategy 1: Phase-Level Metadata (Keep Integration "Ours")
Applied to:
- `ARCHITECT-PROMPT-IDPBUILDER-OCI.md`
- `IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN.md`
- `WAVE-MERGE-PLAN.md`
- `orchestrator-state.json`
- `orchestrator-state.json.bak`

**Rationale**: These files track phase-level state and planning, not wave-specific details.

#### Strategy 2: Project Configuration (Accept Wave "Theirs")
Applied to:
- `.gitignore` (Wave 1)
- `target-repo-config.yaml` (Wave 1)
- `go.mod` (Wave 2)
- `go.sum` (Wave 2)

**Rationale**: Project-wide configuration and build dependencies should use the latest wave's version.

#### Strategy 3: Most Recent Marker (Accept Wave 2)
Applied to:
- `FIX-COMPLETE.marker` (Wave 2)

**Rationale**: Completion markers from later waves supersede earlier ones.

### Conflict Resolution Effectiveness
✅ All conflicts resolved without issues
✅ No manual merge edits required beyond choosing ours/theirs
✅ All strategies followed documented merge plan
✅ Build succeeded after resolution

## Success Criteria Checklist

Phase 1 integration is successful when:

1. ✅ Both Wave 1 and Wave 2 merged without unresolvable conflicts
2. ✅ All Wave 1 content present (verified in git log and package structure)
3. ✅ All Wave 2 content present (verified in git log and package structure)
4. ✅ Package structure matches Wave 2 organization
5. ✅ Build attempted (completed successfully - better than expected!)
6. ⏳ Tests run (in progress - results to be documented)
7. ✅ Integration report created (this document)
8. ⏳ Work log updated (to be done)
9. ⏳ Phase integration branch pushed to remote (pending)

**Overall Status**: 6/9 complete, 3 in progress

## Recommendations

### 1. Push Integration Branch ✅ Ready
The integration branch is ready to be pushed to the remote repository:
```bash
git push target idpbuilder-push-oci/phase1-integration
```

### 2. Monitor Test Results
- Complete test execution and document results
- Classify any failures as upstream or integration issues
- If critical failures found, consider R321 backport protocol

### 3. Phase 1 Completion
Once integration branch is pushed and verified:
- Update orchestrator state to mark Phase 1 as COMPLETED
- Phase 1 can be considered integrated and ready for Phase 2 planning
- Or: Ready for final project delivery if this is the final phase

### 4. Upstream Issue Tracking
If test failures are discovered:
- Document each failure with reproduction steps
- Classify severity (critical, major, minor)
- Decide if R321 backport is needed
- Track in project issue tracker
