# Complete Split Plan for E1.2.3-image-push-operations
**Sole Planner**: Code Reviewer Agent
**Full Path**: phase1/wave2/E1.2.3-image-push-operations
**Parent Branch**: phase1/wave2/image-push-operations
**Total Size**: 1706 lines
**Splits Required**: 3
**Created**: 2025-09-29 20:00:00 UTC

**CRITICAL**: Split boundaries carefully designed to respect logical dependencies and compilation requirements

**SPLIT INTEGRITY NOTICE**
ALL splits below belong to THIS effort ONLY: phase1/wave2/E1.2.3-image-push-operations
NO splits should reference efforts outside this path!

## Split Boundaries (NO OVERLAPS)
| Split | Files | Lines | Size | Description | Status |
|-------|-------|-------|------|-------------|--------|
| 001   | logging.go, progress.go | 1-552 | 552  | Core infrastructure: logging and progress reporting | Planned |
| 002   | discovery.go, pusher.go | 553-1242 | 689  | Image discovery and pusher implementation | Planned |
| 003   | operations.go | 1243-1631 | 389  | Main operation orchestration and integration | Planned |

## Deduplication Matrix
| File/Module | Split 001 | Split 002 | Split 003 |
|-------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| pkg/push/logging.go | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |
| pkg/push/progress.go | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |
| pkg/push/discovery.go | ❌ | ✅ | ❌ |
| pkg/push/pusher.go | ❌ | ✅ | ❌ |
| pkg/push/operations.go | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ |

## Detailed File Breakdown
- **logging.go**: 249 lines - Logging infrastructure for push operations
- **progress.go**: 303 lines - Progress reporting interfaces and implementations
- **discovery.go**: 326 lines - Image discovery from local filesystem
- **pusher.go**: 363 lines - Core image pushing logic with retry mechanisms
- **operations.go**: 389 lines - Main operation orchestration and command integration

## Dependency Graph
```
Split 001 (Infrastructure) - Independent foundation
    ↓
Split 002 (Discovery & Pusher) - Depends on logging and progress interfaces
    ↓
Split 003 (Operations) - Depends on all previous splits for orchestration
```

## Implementation Strategy
1. **Split 001**: Creates foundational logging and progress reporting capabilities
   - Implements PushLogger for structured logging
   - Implements ProgressReporter interface and ConsoleProgressReporter
   - No external dependencies on other splits

2. **Split 002**: Adds image discovery and pushing capabilities
   - Implements LocalImage discovery from filesystem
   - Implements ImagePusher with retry logic
   - Uses logging and progress from Split 001

3. **Split 003**: Adds main operation orchestration
   - Implements PushOperation configuration
   - Implements command-line integration
   - Orchestrates discovery, pushing, and reporting

## Verification Checklist
- [x] No file appears in multiple splits
- [x] All files from original effort covered
- [x] Each split compiles independently (with dependencies)
- [x] Dependencies properly ordered
- [x] Each split <800 lines (target <700)
- [x] Logical cohesion maintained
- [x] No cross-split circular dependencies

## Branch Naming Convention
- Split 001: `phase1/wave2/image-push-operations-split-001`
- Split 002: `phase1/wave2/image-push-operations-split-002`
- Split 003: `phase1/wave2/image-push-operations-split-003`

## Integration Plan
After all splits are completed and reviewed:
1. Merge split-001 into parent branch
2. Merge split-002 into parent branch (after split-001)
3. Merge split-003 into parent branch (after split-002)
4. Verify complete functionality in parent branch
5. Run integration tests
