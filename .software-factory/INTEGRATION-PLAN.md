# Integration Plan - Phase 1 Wave 2
Date: 2025-09-30
Target Branch: phase1-wave2-integration
Base Branch: phase1-wave1-integration

## Branches to Integrate (ordered by R501 and dependencies)
1. phase1/wave2/command-structure (E1.2.1 - base framework)
2. phase1/wave2/registry-authentication-split-001 (E1.2.2 - auth basics)
3. phase1/wave2/registry-authentication-split-002 (E1.2.2 - retry mechanism)
4. phase1/wave2/image-push-operations-split-001 (E1.2.3 - core operations)
5. phase1/wave2/image-push-operations-split-002 (E1.2.3 - tests)
6. phase1/wave2/image-push-operations-split-003 (E1.2.3 - integration)

## Merge Strategy
- Follow R501 Progressive Trunk-Based Development
- Resolve conflicts per R361 (integration only, no new code)
- Version consistency per R381 (keep base versions)
- Document all conflicts and resolutions

## Expected Conflicts
1. E1.2.2 splits: retry package overlaps (split-002 has complete version)
2. E1.2.3 splits: multiple overlaps in discovery.go, pusher.go, etc.

## Expected Outcome
- Fully integrated branch with all Wave 2 features
- No broken builds
- Complete documentation of any issues
