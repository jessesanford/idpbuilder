# Integration Plan
Date: 2025-09-23 15:25:00 UTC
Target Branch: phase1/wave1/integration
Integration Agent: Started at 2025-09-23T15:23:23.517Z

## Branches to Integrate (ordered by lineage)
1. idpbuilderpush/phase1/wave1/command-tests (Effort 1.1.1 - Test foundation)
2. idpbuilderpush/phase1/wave1/command-skeleton (Effort 1.1.2 - Core implementation)
3. idpbuilderpush/phase1/wave1/integration-tests (Effort 1.1.3 - Integration validation)

## Merge Strategy
- Order based on dependency relationships (tests → implementation → integration)
- Use --no-ff to preserve merge history
- Test after EACH merge to ensure stability
- Document all conflict resolutions

## Expected Conflicts
1. Step 1 (command-tests): No conflicts expected
2. Step 2 (command-skeleton): Potential conflict in cmd/push/root_test.go
3. Step 3 (integration-tests): Expected conflicts in config.go and root.go

## Conflict Resolution Strategy
- root_test.go: Keep ALL test functions from both branches
- config.go: Keep RegistryURL field from effort 1.1.2
- root.go: Merge all functionality from both branches

## Expected Outcome
- Fully integrated branch with all three efforts
- All tests passing
- Build successful
- Complete documentation in .software-factory/
