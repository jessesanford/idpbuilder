# Integration Plan
Date: 2025-09-24
Target Branch: idpbuilderpush/phase2/wave2/integration
Base Branch: idpbuilderpush/phase2/wave1/integration

## Branches to Integrate
1. phase2/wave2/flow-tests (remote branch exists)
2. phase2/wave2/auth-flow (needs recovery from local workspace)

## Critical Issues Identified
- R308 VIOLATION: Effort branches incorrectly based on `main` instead of previous wave
- auth-flow branch missing from remote
- CANNOT use cherry-pick (violates Integration Agent SUPREME LAW)

## Alternative Merge Strategy (NO CHERRY-PICK)
Since cherry-pick is forbidden, will use:
1. Full merge with conflict resolution for flow-tests
2. Manual file recovery and commit for auth-flow
3. Preserve complete history per Integration Agent rules

## Expected Outcome
- Fully integrated branch with both efforts
- All tests passing
- Complete documentation
- NO cherry-picks used
- Full history preserved
