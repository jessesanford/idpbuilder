🚨 HARD LIMIT VIOLATION: Branch exceeds 800 lines of IMPLEMENTATION code!
   This branch MUST be split immediately.
✅ Total implementation lines: 1798
```

## Size Analysis
- **Current Lines**: 1798 lines (measuring from main)
- **Limit**: 800 lines
- **Status**: EXCEEDS by 998 lines
- **Requires Split**: NO - This IS a split (but has wrong baseline)

### Detailed File Analysis:
```
pkg/push/discovery.go: 326 lines ✓ (belongs to split-002)
pkg/push/pusher.go: 363 lines ✓ (belongs to split-002)
pkg/push/logging.go: 249 lines ✗ (belongs to split-001)
pkg/push/progress.go: 303 lines ✗ (belongs to split-001)
pkg/push/operations.go: 390 lines ✗ (belongs to split-003)
```

**CRITICAL ISSUE**: The split includes ALL files from the entire effort instead of just the split-002 specific files.

## Functionality Review
- ✅ Requirements implemented correctly for discovery.go and pusher.go
- ✅ LocalImage struct properly defined with all required fields
- ✅ DiscoveryOptions with sensible defaults
- ✅ Support for both tarball and OCI layout formats
- ✅ ImagePusher with retry logic and exponential backoff
- ✅ Proper authentication handling
- ✅ Progress reporter integration
- ❌ Split includes files that don't belong to split-002

## Code Quality
- ✅ Clean, readable code
- ✅ Proper variable naming
- ✅ Appropriate comments and documentation
- ✅ No code smells detected
- ✅ go vet passes without warnings
- ✅ Proper error handling throughout
- ✅ Good use of go-containerregistry library

## Implementation Issues

### 1. CRITICAL: Split Boundaries Violated
The split includes ALL files from the entire effort:
- Split-002 should ONLY have: discovery.go (326 lines) + pusher.go (363 lines) = 689 lines
- Current split has: ALL 5 files = 1631 lines of Go code
- This violates the split boundary requirements

### 2. Incorrect Base Branch
- The split appears to be based on `main` instead of `phase1/wave2/image-push-operations-split-001`
- According to the split plan, split-002 should build on top of split-001
- This explains why all files are included instead of just the incremental changes

### 3. Missing Tests
- ❌ No unit tests found for discovery.go
- ❌ No unit tests found for pusher.go
- ❌ No integration tests implemented

## Pattern Compliance
- ✅ Go patterns followed correctly
- ✅ Proper use of interfaces (ProgressReporter)
- ✅ Good separation of concerns
- ✅ Proper package structure

## Security Review
- ✅ No hardcoded credentials
- ✅ TLS configuration handled properly
- ✅ Authentication properly abstracted
- ✅ Input validation in discovery functions

## Issues Found

### CRITICAL Issues:
1. **Split Boundary Violation**: Split includes files from split-001 (logging.go, progress.go) and split-003 (operations.go)
2. **Incorrect Baseline**: Split appears to be based on main instead of split-001
3. **Size Limit Exceeded**: 1798 lines when measuring from main (should be ~689 lines for just split-002 files)

### Major Issues:
1. **No Tests**: Missing unit tests for both discovery.go and pusher.go

### Minor Issues:
1. **contains() function**: Custom implementation could use strings.Contains() instead (lines 284-300 in pusher.go)

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions Required:
1. **REBUILD SPLIT CORRECTLY**:
   - Start from split-001 branch (not main)
   - Only add discovery.go and pusher.go
   - Remove logging.go, progress.go, and operations.go from this split

2. **Fix Branching Strategy**:
   ```bash
   git checkout phase1/wave2/image-push-operations-split-001
   git checkout -b phase1/wave2/image-push-operations-split-002-fixed
   # Then add ONLY discovery.go and pusher.go
   ```

3. **Add Tests**:
   - Create discovery_test.go with tests for discovery functions
   - Create pusher_test.go with tests for push operations
   - Target at least 80% coverage

## Next Steps
**NEEDS_FIXES**: The split must be rebuilt with correct boundaries:
1. Base the split on split-001, not main
2. Include ONLY discovery.go and pusher.go (689 lines total)
3. Add comprehensive unit tests
4. Verify size is under 800 lines when properly measured

## Positive Aspects
Despite the split boundary issues, the actual implementation quality is excellent:
- Well-structured code with clear interfaces
- Proper error handling and retry logic
- Good use of go-containerregistry library
- Clean separation of concerns
- Comprehensive functionality for both discovery and pushing

The code itself is production-ready; it just needs to be properly organized into the correct split boundaries.

**Grading Impact**:
- -50% for exceeding size limit (1798 > 800)
- -30% for incorrect split boundaries
- -20% for missing tests
- Potential recovery to passing grade if fixes are implemented correctly
