# Deprecated State Removal Report

## Manager: software-factory-manager

## üî¥ CRITICAL ISSUE RESOLVED

The orchestrator was failing because it was trying to use deprecated states (PLANNING and MONITOR) that were still listed as valid in system files but had been replaced with more specific states.

## üìä States Removed

### Deprecated States:
1. **PLANNING** - Generic planning state (deprecated 2025-08-30)
   - Replaced by: SPAWN_ARCHITECT_PHASE_PLANNING, SPAWN_ARCHITECT_WAVE_PLANNING, SPAWN_CODE_REVIEWERS_EFFORT_PLANNING
   
2. **MONITOR** - Generic monitoring state  
   - Replaced by: MONITOR_IMPLEMENTATION, MONITOR_REVIEWS, MONITOR_FIXES

## üìù Files Modified

### 1. SOFTWARE-FACTORY-STATE-MACHINE.md
- ‚úÖ Removed MONITOR from orchestrator valid states list
- ‚úÖ Updated all transitions from MONITOR ‚Üí MONITOR_IMPLEMENTATION/MONITOR_REVIEWS/MONITOR_FIXES
- ‚úÖ Fixed mermaid diagram to use specialized monitoring states
- ‚úÖ Updated validation examples to not reference deprecated states
- ‚úÖ Fixed R232 documentation to reference MONITOR_* states

### 2. orchestrator-state.json.example
- ‚úÖ Changed code_reviewer_planning_states current_mode from "PLANNING" to "EFFORT_PLAN_CREATION"

### 3. .claude/agents/orchestrator.md
- ‚úÖ Removed PLANNING from valid states list
- ‚úÖ Removed MONITOR from valid states list
- ‚úÖ Added WAVE_START as proper replacement for PLANNING
- ‚úÖ Added MONITOR_IMPLEMENTATION, MONITOR_REVIEWS, MONITOR_FIXES

### 4. .claude/commands/continue-orchestrating.md
- ‚úÖ Updated INIT ‚Üí WAVE_START (was PLANNING)
- ‚úÖ Updated SPAWN_AGENTS ‚Üí MONITOR_IMPLEMENTATION (was MONITOR)
- ‚úÖ Added cases for MONITOR_REVIEWS and MONITOR_FIXES

### 5. agent-states/integration/INIT/rules.md
- ‚úÖ Fixed transition from INIT ‚Üí MERGING (was PLANNING)

### 6. agent-states/orchestrator/STATE-DIRECTORY-MAP.md
- ‚úÖ Replaced PLANNING with WAVE_START
- ‚úÖ Replaced MONITOR with MONITOR_IMPLEMENTATION, MONITOR_REVIEWS, MONITOR_FIXES

## üìÅ Directories Deleted

- ‚úÖ `agent-states/orchestrator/PLANNING/` - Completely removed
- ‚úÖ `agent-states/orchestrator/MONITOR/` - Completely removed

## üéØ Impact

### Before:
- Orchestrator would attempt to transition to PLANNING or MONITOR states
- These states existed in documentation but had deprecated or missing rules
- Caused orchestrator to fail or get stuck

### After:
- All references to deprecated states removed
- Orchestrator will only use current, valid states with proper rules
- State machine is consistent across all files

## ‚úÖ Verification

### States Now Properly Defined:
- WAVE_START (replaces PLANNING for wave initiation)
- SPAWN_ARCHITECT_PHASE_PLANNING (specific planning state)
- SPAWN_ARCHITECT_WAVE_PLANNING (specific planning state)
- SPAWN_CODE_REVIEWERS_EFFORT_PLANNING (specific planning state)
- MONITOR_IMPLEMENTATION (replaces generic MONITOR)
- MONITOR_REVIEWS (replaces generic MONITOR)
- MONITOR_FIXES (replaces generic MONITOR)

### Clean State Machine:
- No deprecated states listed as valid
- All transitions use current states
- All examples use current states
- All agent configs use current states

## üîí Prevention

To prevent future issues:
1. Never add states without creating corresponding `agent-states/[agent]/[STATE]/rules.md`
2. When deprecating states, immediately remove from:
   - SOFTWARE-FACTORY-STATE-MACHINE.md
   - Agent configuration files
   - Command files
   - Example state files
3. Use the factory manager to validate state consistency regularly

## üìã Commits

1. `07a1df5` - fix: remove all deprecated PLANNING and MONITOR states from system
2. `54afbe6` - fix: remove remaining deprecated state references

## üöÄ Next Steps

The orchestrator should now be able to:
1. Start properly without trying to use deprecated states
2. Transition through the correct state sequence
3. Use only states that have proper rules defined

The system is now consistent and ready for use.
