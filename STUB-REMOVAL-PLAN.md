# ðŸš¨ CRITICAL: STUB REMOVAL PLAN - Phase 2 Wave 1

## Problem Statement
The Integration Agent discovered STUBS in `gitea-client-split-002/stubs.go` which is ABSOLUTELY FORBIDDEN.
This violates core Software Factory principles - ALL code must be real implementations.

## Identified Stub Locations

### 1. gitea-client-split-002/stubs.go
- File: `efforts/phase2/wave1/gitea-client-split-002/pkg/gitea/stubs.go`
- Contains: Placeholder implementations
- Issue: Incomplete type definitions and interface methods
- Impact: Tests cannot compile, functionality is fake

### 2. Function Naming Issues
- `retryWithExponentialBackoff` vs `RetryWithExponentialBackoff`
- Compatibility wrapper was added but this is a band-aid

## Fix Strategy

### Step 1: Analyze Stub Content
- Identify what each stub is supposed to implement
- Map stubs to their required functionality
- Determine dependencies from split-001

### Step 2: Create Implementation Plan
- Spawn Code Reviewer to analyze and plan real implementations
- Document exact functionality needed for each stub
- Ensure consistency with split-001

### Step 3: Implement Real Code
- Spawn SW Engineer to replace ALL stubs with real implementations
- No placeholders, no TODOs in code, no incomplete functions
- Every interface method must have real logic

### Step 4: Verify and Test
- Run full test suite
- Ensure all tests pass (not partial)
- Verify demos still work
- Re-run integration

## State Machine Flow

1. ERROR_RECOVERY (current) - Identifying stub problem
2. SPAWN_CODE_REVIEWER_FIX_PLAN - Create detailed fix plan
3. SPAWN_ENGINEERS_FOR_FIXES - Implement real code
4. MONITOR_FIXES - Track fix progress
5. SPAWN_INTEGRATION_AGENT - Re-integrate without stubs
6. MONITORING_INTEGRATION - Verify clean integration

## Success Criteria
- âœ… ZERO stubs in any code
- âœ… ALL tests passing (not partial)
- âœ… Full functionality implemented
- âœ… Clean integration with no workarounds
