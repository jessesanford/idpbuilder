# Split Summary for E1.2.2 fallback-strategies-split-002

## Executive Summary
**Problem**: Split 002 implementation exceeded the 800-line hard limit with 1,061 lines.
**Solution**: Divide into 3 sub-splits to maintain compliance while preserving functionality.
**Status**: 2 components already implemented, 1 component (tests) pending.

## Size Violation Analysis

### Original Plan vs Actual Implementation
| Component | Planned Lines | Actual Lines | Variance |
|-----------|--------------|--------------|----------|
| logger.go | 232 | 370 | +138 (+60%) |
| recommendations.go | 344 | 691 | +347 (+101%) |
| Tests | 680 | 0 (not done) | -680 |
| **TOTAL** | 1,256 | 1,061 (no tests) | N/A |

### Root Cause of Overrun
1. **Comprehensive Implementation**: The SW Engineer created more thorough implementations than estimated
2. **Recommendations Complexity**: The recommendation engine required more code for proper context handling
3. **Security Features**: Additional security logging features were added for completeness

## Sub-Split Strategy

### Three-Way Split Decision Rationale
- **Split 002A**: Logger (370 lines) - Self-contained, acceptable size
- **Split 002B**: Recommendations (691 lines) - Near limit but functional unit
- **Split 002C**: Tests (~680 lines) - Keep all tests together

### Why Not Two Splits?
- Combining logger + recommendations = 1,061 lines (EXCEEDS LIMIT)
- Splitting recommendations would break functional cohesion
- Tests naturally form a separate unit

## Implementation Status

| Split | Component | Lines | Status | Action Required |
|-------|-----------|-------|--------|-----------------|
| 002A | logger.go | 370 | ✅ Complete | Review only |
| 002B | recommendations.go | 691 | ✅ Complete | Review only |
| 002C | Test suite | ~680 | ❌ Not started | IMPLEMENT |

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk Areas
1. **Split 002B Size**: At 691 lines, very close to 700-line soft limit
   - **Mitigation**: NO additions allowed, any changes require refactoring first

2. **Test Coverage**: No tests implemented yet
   - **Mitigation**: Split 002C dedicated entirely to testing

3. **Integration**: Dependencies between splits
   - **Mitigation**: Clear import structure defined

### Low Risk Areas
1. **Split 002A**: Well under limit with 430-line buffer
2. **Split 002C**: Good margin with ~120-line buffer for tests

## Recommended Execution Sequence

### Phase 1: Review Existing Work
1. **Review Split 002A** (logger.go)
   - Verify compilation
   - Check interface definitions
   - Validate size with line-counter.sh

2. **Review Split 002B** (recommendations.go)
   - Verify imports from 002A work
   - Ensure no additional code needed
   - Monitor size carefully

### Phase 2: Complete Implementation
3. **Implement Split 002C** (tests)
   - Create comprehensive test suite
   - Achieve >80% coverage
   - Verify integration between 002A and 002B

### Phase 3: Integration
4. **Merge Strategy**
   - Each split gets separate review
   - Merge in sequence: 002A → 002B → 002C
   - Final integration testing

## Orchestrator Instructions

### For Existing Code (002A & 002B)
```bash
# These files already exist in current directory
# Option 1: Keep in place and review
# Option 2: Move to sub-splits if needed for isolation
```

### For New Implementation (002C)
```bash
# Spawn SW Engineer to implement tests
# Ensure engineer understands:
# - Maximum 680 lines for all tests
# - Must test both logger and recommendations
# - Integration tests required
```

## Validation Checklist
- [x] Total lines under control (<800 per split)
- [x] Functional cohesion maintained
- [x] Dependencies clearly defined
- [x] Implementation sequence logical
- [ ] All splits reviewed
- [ ] Tests implemented
- [ ] Integration verified

## Compliance Verification
```bash
# Run from effort directory
PROJECT_ROOT="/home/vscode/workspaces/idpbuilder-oci-go-cr"

# Verify Split 002A size
wc -l pkg/certs/fallback/logger.go
# Expected: 370 lines

# Verify Split 002B size
wc -l pkg/certs/fallback/recommendations.go  
# Expected: 691 lines

# After 002C implementation, verify test size
wc -l pkg/certs/fallback/*_test.go
# Expected: <680 lines total
```

## Summary
The 3-way split strategy successfully manages the size violation while maintaining functional integrity. Two components are complete and compliant, with only the test suite remaining to be implemented. The highest risk is Split 002B's proximity to the soft limit, requiring careful monitoring.
