## Wave Review Authority

---
### üö® RULE R057.0.0 - Wave Review Authority
**Source:** rule-library/RULE-REGISTRY.md#R057
**Criticality:** CRITICAL - Major impact on grading

WAVE DECISIONS:
- PROCEED: Architecture sound, continue to next wave
- PROCEED_WITH_CHANGES: Minor issues, create addendum
- STOP: Critical violations found, cannot continue

STOP CRITERIA:
- Multi-tenancy boundary violations
- Critical pattern breaks
- Security vulnerabilities
- Integration impossibilities
- Race conditions
---

## Phase Assessment Authority

---
### ‚ÑπÔ∏è RULE R058.0.0 - Phase Assessment Responsibility
**Source:** rule-library/RULE-REGISTRY.md#R058
**Criticality:** INFO - Best practice

PHASE DECISIONS:
- ON_TRACK: Can achieve all planned features
- NEEDS_CORRECTION: Adjustments required but recoverable
- OFF_TRACK: Cannot achieve goals, must STOP

ASSESSMENT CRITERIA:
- Feature completeness vs plan
- Technical debt accumulation
- Integration stability
- Performance metrics
- Timeline feasibility
---

## Pattern Validation

---
### ‚ÑπÔ∏è RULE R059.0.0 - Pattern Validation
**Source:** rule-library/RULE-REGISTRY.md#R059
**Criticality:** INFO - Best practice

PATTERNS TO CHECK:
- Controller architecture
- API design consistency
- Multi-tenancy isolation
- Error handling patterns
- Testing strategies
- Resource management

VALIDATION:
‚úÖ Pattern followed correctly
‚ö†Ô∏è Pattern deviation with justification
‚ùå Pattern violation without justification
---

## Addendum Creation

---
### ‚ÑπÔ∏è RULE R057.1.0 - Addendum Creation
**Source:** rule-library/RULE-REGISTRY.md#R057
**Criticality:** INFO - Best practice

WHEN: Decision is PROCEED_WITH_CHANGES

ADDENDUM MUST CONTAIN:
1. Required changes for next wave
2. Pattern adjustments needed
3. Integration approach modifications
4. Validation checklist for compliance
5. Testing requirements updates

## Grading Per State

| State | Primary Metric | Target | Grade Impact |
|-------|---------------|--------|--------------|
| MAKE_WAVE_DECISION | Decision accuracy | No false STOPs | CRITICAL |
| ASSESS_TRAJECTORY | Trajectory accuracy | Correct assessment | HIGH |
| CHECK_PATTERNS | Pattern detection | All violations caught | HIGH |
| CREATE_ADDENDUM | Addendum clarity | Next wave succeeds | MEDIUM |

## Review Documentation

---
### ‚ö†Ô∏è RULE R040.0.0 - Documentation Requirements
**Source:** rule-library/RULE-REGISTRY.md#R040
**Criticality:** IMPORTANT - Affects workflow

REVIEW OUTPUT FILES:

Wave Review:
PHASE{X}-WAVE{Y}-ARCHITECT-REVIEW-{timestamp}.md

Phase Assessment:
PHASE{X}-START-ASSESSMENT-{timestamp}.md

Integration Review:
PHASE{X}-INTEGRATION-REVIEW-{timestamp}.md

ALL MUST INCLUDE:
- Executive Summary
- Decision with rationale
- Issues found (by severity)
- Recommendations
- Risk assessment
---

## Critical Violations

Automatic STOP triggers:
- Multi-tenancy boundary breach
- Security vulnerability
- Data corruption risk
- Race condition detected
- Fundamental pattern break
