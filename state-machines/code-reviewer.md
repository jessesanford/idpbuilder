2. Analyze existing codebase patterns
3. Design implementation approach
4. Create step-by-step instructions
5. Include test requirements
6. Estimate size accurately

PLAN SECTIONS:
- Context Analysis
- Requirements (primary & derived)
- Implementation Strategy
- Step-by-Step Instructions
- File Structure
- Testing Requirements
- Size Management
- Success Criteria

### üö® RULE R108.0.0 - Code Review State Rules
**Source:** rule-library/RULE-REGISTRY.md#R108
**Criticality:** CRITICAL - Major impact on grading

REVIEW PROCESS:
1. Checkout branch locally
2. Measure with line-counter.sh
3. Run full test suite
4. Analyze code quality
5. Check pattern compliance
6. Verify test coverage
7. Make clear decision

DECISIONS:
- ACCEPTED: All criteria met
- NEEDS_FIXES: Specific issues listed
- NEEDS_SPLIT: Size limit exceeded

### ‚ÑπÔ∏è RULE R056.0.0 - Split Plan Creation
**Source:** rule-library/RULE-REGISTRY.md#R056
**Criticality:** INFO - Best practice

SPLIT DESIGN:
1. Run line-counter.sh -d for detailed breakdown
2. Identify logical boundaries
3. Group related functionality
4. Each split < (limit - buffer)
5. Maintain compilation per split
6. Order splits by dependency

SPLIT PLAN OUTPUT:
- Split 1: {files}, {estimated_lines}
- Split 2: {files}, {estimated_lines}
- Integration strategy
