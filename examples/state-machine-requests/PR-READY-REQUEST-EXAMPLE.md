# Request for Software Factory Manager
## Design State Machine for PR-Ready Branch Transformation

### Background
We have successfully transformed 16 Software Factory effort branches into production-ready PR branches through a manual process. This process involved removing all Software Factory artifacts, fixing critical issues, consolidating commits, and ensuring clean merges. We now need to formalize this into a repeatable state machine process.

### Request
Design a state machine with appropriate states and agent assignments to automatically transform Software Factory effort branches into PR-ready branches suitable for upstream pull requests.

### Process Document
Please review the attached comprehensive process document: `/tmp/PR-READY-TRANSFORMATION-PROCESS.md`

This document details our complete 7-phase process:
1. **Discovery and Assessment** - Inventory branches and identify contamination
2. **Cleanup and Sanitization** - Remove all SF artifacts
3. **Commit Consolidation** - Squash commits while preserving history
4. **Integrity Verification** - Ensure no core files deleted
5. **Sequential Rebase** - Properly structure branch dependencies
6. **Validation and Testing** - Comprehensive merge testing
7. **Final Preparation** - Push branches and create documentation

### Key Requirements for State Machine Design

#### Critical Capabilities Needed:
1. **Artifact Detection** - Identify and remove all Software Factory metadata
2. **Branch Analysis** - Understand dependencies and merge order
3. **Integrity Protection** - Prevent deletion of core application files
4. **Conflict Resolution** - Handle predictable merge conflicts
5. **Validation Testing** - Ensure branches merge cleanly

#### Quality Gates Required:
- Zero SF artifacts remaining
- Core files preserved
- Clean commit history
- Successful merge tests
- Build verification

#### Error Recovery Needs:
- Rollback capability for each phase
- Detection of destructive changes
- Conflict resolution strategies
- Broken dependency handling

### Specific Challenges to Address

1. **Branch 8 Syndrome** - We discovered a branch that accidentally deleted 90,000 lines of core code. The state machine must detect and prevent this.

2. **Sequential Dependencies** - Branches build on each other. The state machine must maintain proper sequencing.

3. **Conflict Patterns** - Certain files (like pkg/certs/*) repeatedly have add/add conflicts. Need consistent resolution strategy.

4. **Naming Conventions** - Some branches had incorrect names. Need validation and correction capability.

### Expected Deliverables

Please design:
1. **State Machine Definition** with states for each phase
2. **State Transition Rules** with clear entry/exit conditions
3. **Agent Assignments** for each state (which agent type handles what)
4. **Error States** and recovery procedures
5. **Validation Checkpoints** throughout the process
6. **Parallel vs Sequential** execution plan

### Success Criteria

The state machine should be able to:
- Transform any SF effort branch into a PR-ready branch
- Detect and prevent core file deletion
- Handle common conflicts automatically
- Produce branches that merge cleanly to upstream
- Complete the process without manual intervention (except for unusual conflicts)

### Additional Context

We've learned that this process is:
- **Highly predictable** - Same conflicts appear in same files
- **Mostly automatable** - 87.5% of merges are clean
- **Critical for quality** - Prevents breaking production code
- **Time-sensitive** - Manual process takes hours, automation could do it in minutes

### Questions for Your Design

1. Should artifact removal be done in parallel across branches or sequentially?
2. How should the state machine handle unexpected conflicts?
3. What level of human approval should be required at gates?
4. Should there be a "dry run" mode for validation?
5. How should progress be reported during execution?

### Priority Order

Please prioritize:
1. **Safety** - Never delete core files
2. **Correctness** - Proper artifact removal
3. **Completeness** - All branches processed
4. **Speed** - Efficient execution

### Timeline
This state machine will be used repeatedly as we prepare effort branches for production PRs. It's a critical component of the Software Factory 2.0 workflow.

Please proceed with designing a comprehensive state machine that can reliably transform Software Factory effort branches into clean, PR-ready branches. Use the detailed process document as your guide, but feel free to optimize and improve the process based on state machine best practices.
