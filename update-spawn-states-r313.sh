## ðŸ”´ðŸ”´ðŸ”´ R313 MANDATORY: STOP AFTER SPAWNING AGENTS ðŸ”´ðŸ”´ðŸ”´

**CRITICAL REQUIREMENT PER R313:**
After spawning ANY agents in this state, you MUST:
1. Record what was spawned in state file
2. Save TODOs per R287
3. Commit and push state changes
4. Display stop message with continuation instructions
5. EXIT immediately with code 0

**VIOLATION = AUTOMATIC -100% FAILURE**

See: `$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/rule-library/R313-mandatory-stop-after-spawn.md`
