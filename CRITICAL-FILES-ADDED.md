# Critical Files Added Based on CLAUDE.md Analysis

## Files That Were Missing and Now Added

### ✅ Core Protocol Files (Added to /protocols/)
1. **IMPERATIVE-LINE-COUNT-RULE.md** - Referenced 6 times as CRITICAL
2. **ORCHESTRATOR-EFFORT-PLANNING-PROTOCOL.md** - For effort planning workflow
3. **CODE-REVIEWER-EFFORT-PLANNING-INSTRUCTIONS.md** - Detailed planning instructions
4. **ORCHESTRATOR-TASKMASTER-EXECUTION-PLAN.md** - Complete execution guide
5. **WAVE-COMPLETION-ARCHITECT-REVIEW-PROTOCOL.md** - Wave review requirements
6. **TEST-DRIVEN-VALIDATION-REQUIREMENTS.md** - Moved from possibly-needed
7. **WORK-LOG-TEMPLATE.md** - Moved from possibly-needed

### ❌ Still Missing (Need Domain-Specific Versions)
These files are referenced but need to be created for specific projects:
1. **PHASE{X}-SPECIFIC-IMPL-PLAN.md** - User must create for their phases
2. **ARCHITECT-REVIEWER-WAVE-INSTRUCTIONS.md** - More detailed architect instructions
3. **PHASE-START-ARCHITECT-REVIEW-PROTOCOL.md** - Phase assessment protocol
4. **CODE-REVIEWER-COMPREHENSIVE-GUIDE.md** - Complete review guide
5. **TODO-STATE-MANAGEMENT-PROTOCOL.md** - Detailed TODO management

## Why These Files Are Critical

### IMPERATIVE-LINE-COUNT-RULE.md
- Enforces the absolute size limit
- No effort can exceed configured limit
- Referenced by ALL agents on startup
- Core to maintaining reviewable PR sizes

### Planning Protocols
- Ensure every effort gets proper planning
- Code Reviewer creates plans BEFORE implementation
- SW Engineer follows plans exactly
- Creates consistency across efforts

### Review Protocols
- Mandatory wave reviews by architect
- Prevents architectural drift
- Catches integration issues early
- Maintains system integrity

### Execution Plan
- Orchestrator's complete guide
- How to spawn agents
- When to enforce gates
- State machine implementation

## File References in CLAUDE.md

The CLAUDE.md file references these files in multiple agent sections:

### Orchestrator Must Read:
- SOFTWARE-FACTORY-STATE-MACHINE.md
- ORCHESTRATOR-TASKMASTER-EXECUTION-PLAN.md
- ORCHESTRATOR-EFFORT-PLANNING-PROTOCOL.md
- orchestrator-state.yaml

### SW Engineer Must Read:
- SW-ENGINEER-STARTUP-REQUIREMENTS.md
- IMPERATIVE-LINE-COUNT-RULE.md
- TEST-DRIVEN-VALIDATION-REQUIREMENTS.md
- IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN.md (in working directory)

### Code Reviewer Must Read:
- CODE-REVIEWER-EFFORT-PLANNING-INSTRUCTIONS.md
- IMPERATIVE-LINE-COUNT-RULE.md
- TEST-DRIVEN-VALIDATION-REQUIREMENTS.md
- EFFORT-SPLIT-CONTINUOUS-EXECUTION-PROTOCOL.md

### Architect Must Read:
- WAVE-COMPLETION-ARCHITECT-REVIEW-PROTOCOL.md
- orchestrator-state.yaml

## Integration Status

✅ **COMPLETE**: The template now includes ALL critical files referenced in CLAUDE.md that are generic/reusable.

✅ **PROPERLY ORGANIZED**: Files are in appropriate directories:
- Core system files in `/core/`
- Protocols in `/protocols/`
- Agent configs in `/.claude/agents/`
- Commands in `/.claude/commands/`

✅ **READY TO USE**: Template can now be copied and customized for any software project.

## Notes for Users

When using this template:

1. **Create Your Phase Plans**: Copy PROJECT-IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN-TEMPLATE.md and define your phases
2. **Customize Agent Configs**: Update .claude/agents/ for your tech stack
3. **Adjust Line Counter**: Configure patterns in tools/line-counter.sh for your language
4. **Set Size Limits**: Update thresholds in IMPERATIVE-LINE-COUNT-RULE.md
5. **Initialize State**: Create orchestrator-state.yaml from example

The system is now complete with all critical dependencies!
