# R321 Backport Analysis - Fallback Strategies

## Assignment
Fix fallback strategy test setup issues

## Analysis Results

### Test Status
- ✅ Fallback package tests: **PASSING** (All 15 tests pass)
- ✅ Insecure package tests: **PASSING** (All 8 tests pass)
- ✅ Build status: **SUCCESSFUL**
- ✅ Dependencies: **CLEAN**

### Test Coverage
- Fallback package: **83.8%** coverage
- Insecure package: **100%** coverage

### Findings
No test setup issues were found. The fallback and insecure packages are:

1. **Fully functional**: All tests pass without errors
2. **Well-covered**: High test coverage indicating robust testing
3. **Properly structured**: No missing test fixtures or testdata directories needed
4. **Dependency-complete**: No missing imports or modules

### Conclusion
The fallback strategy tests were already in working condition. No fixes were required.

## Executed Commands
```bash
go test ./pkg/fallback/... -v    # All tests PASS
go test ./pkg/insecure/... -v    # All tests PASS  
go test -race ./pkg/fallback/... ./pkg/insecure/... -v  # All tests PASS with race detection
go test ./pkg/fallback/... ./pkg/insecure/... -cover   # High coverage confirmed
go build ./pkg/fallback/... ./pkg/insecure/...         # Build successful
go mod tidy                                            # Dependencies clean
```
