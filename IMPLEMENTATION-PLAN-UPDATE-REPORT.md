# IMPLEMENTATION PLAN UPDATE REPORT

## Date: 2025-09-06
## Updated By: Software Factory Manager

## Summary
Successfully updated IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN.md to align with all current Software Factory 2.0 rules and best practices.

## Critical Updates Applied

### 1. Agent Role Clarifications
- **Orchestrator**: 
  - ONLY coordinates, never writes code (R006)
  - NEVER measures code (R319) - must delegate to Code Reviewer
  - Must STOP at every state transition (R322)
  - Cannot make technical assessments

- **Code Reviewer**: 
  - Plans efforts and MUST measure ALL code (R319 primary duty)
  - MUST detect and reject stub implementations (R320)
  - MUST verify final artifact build (R323)
  - Creates split plans when >800 lines

- **SW Engineer**: 
  - Implements features with COMPLETE functionality (no stubs - R320)
  - Fixes issues immediately in source branches (R321)
  - MUST build final artifact (R323)

- **Architect**: 
  - Reviews wave/phase completions
  - Provides architectural guidance

### 2. State Machine Alignment
- Wave integrations → Phase integrations → PROJECT integration (R283 mandatory)
- Proper backporting (R321 - immediate backport during integration, not deferred)
- Build validation includes final artifact (R323)
- Mandatory stops at state transitions (R322)
- Correct state flow with R234 mandatory sequences

### 3. Critical Rules Emphasized
- **R006**: Orchestrator never writes code
- **R319**: Orchestrator never measures, Code Reviewer always measures
- **R320**: No stub implementations allowed
- **R321**: Immediate backport during integration (not deferred)
- **R322**: Stop at every state transition
- **R323**: Must build final artifact
- **R151**: Parallel spawning with <5s timestamps
- **R283**: Project-level integration is mandatory

### 4. Planning Structure Corrections
- Code Reviewers create effort plans (not orchestrators)
- Split planning when >700 lines (soft) or >800 lines (hard)
- Each effort must be independently mergeable
- Project-level integration is MANDATORY

### 5. Workflow Corrections
- No automatic transitions between states (R322)
- Code Reviewers do all technical validation
- SW Engineers handle all code modifications
- Integration branches are READ-ONLY (R321)
- Integration agents do merges only (not orchestrators)

### 6. Success Criteria Updates
- Must have final binary artifact (R323)
- No stub implementations (R320)
- All fixes in source branches (R321)
- Process compliance metrics added

## Sections Added/Modified

1. **New Section**: Critical Software Factory 2.0 Rules (after Executive Summary)
2. **New Section**: Critical Workflow Corrections (before Project Statistics)
3. **Updated**: All agent descriptions with rule references
4. **Updated**: Grading criteria with specific rule penalties
5. **Updated**: Gate descriptions with rule compliance
6. **Updated**: Success definition with R320, R321, R323 compliance
7. **Updated**: Definition of Done with process compliance metrics

## Document Metadata
- Version updated: 1.2 → 2.0
- Framework: Software Factory 2.0 (Full Compliance)
- Rules Applied: R006, R319, R320, R321, R322, R323, R151, R283, R288

## Validation Checklist
✅ Orchestrator role clarified (never writes/measures)
✅ Code Reviewer measuring responsibility emphasized
✅ No stub implementations rule added
✅ Immediate backport protocol explained
✅ Mandatory stops at transitions documented
✅ Final artifact requirement added
✅ State machine flow aligned
✅ Integration protocol corrected
✅ Parallel spawning requirements added
✅ Project integration made mandatory

## Impact
This updated IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN.md will ensure:
1. Orchestrators don't violate R006 or R319
2. Code Reviewers fulfill their measurement duties
3. No stub implementations pass review
4. Integration fixes happen in source branches
5. Final artifact is always built
6. State transitions have proper stops
7. Project starts correctly with proper understanding

## Status
✅ Updates complete
✅ File committed locally
⚠️ Push to remote failed (permissions issue)

## Next Steps
The updated IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN.md is ready for use. It now correctly reflects:
- Current Software Factory 2.0 best practices
- All critical rules (R006, R319, R320, R321, R322, R323, etc.)
- Proper agent roles and responsibilities
- Correct state machine flow
- Mandatory project integration
- Complete functionality requirements (no stubs)

This plan will guide the project to successful implementation following all Software Factory 2.0 patterns.
