# SPLIT-PLAN-002A.md - Logger Component

## Split 002A of 3: Security Logger Implementation
**Planner**: Code Reviewer (R199 - sole split planner)
**Parent Effort**: E1.2.2 fallback-strategies-split-002
**Created**: 2025-09-01 10:38:00 UTC

<!-- ⚠️ ORCHESTRATOR METADATA PLACEHOLDER - DO NOT REMOVE ⚠️ -->
<!-- The orchestrator will add infrastructure metadata below: -->
<!-- WORKING_DIRECTORY, BRANCH, REMOTE, BASE_BRANCH, etc. -->
<!-- SW Engineers MUST read this metadata to navigate to the correct directory -->
<!-- END PLACEHOLDER -->

## Boundaries (⚠️⚠️⚠️ CRITICAL: All splits MUST reference SAME effort!)
- **Previous Split**: Split 001 of phase1/wave2/fallback-strategies
  - Path: efforts/phase1/wave2/fallback-strategies-split-001/
  - Branch: phase1/wave2/fallback-strategies-split-001
  - Summary: Implemented certificate detection and error parsing (completed)
- **This Split**: Split 002A of phase1/wave2/fallback-strategies-split-002
  - Path: efforts/phase1/wave2/fallback-strategies-split-002/split-002a/
  - Branch: phase1/wave2/fallback-strategies-split-002a
- **Next Split**: Split 002B of phase1/wave2/fallback-strategies-split-002
  - Path: efforts/phase1/wave2/fallback-strategies-split-002/split-002b/
  - Branch: phase1/wave2/fallback-strategies-split-002b

## Files in This Split (EXCLUSIVE - no overlap with other splits)
- `pkg/certs/fallback/logger.go` - 370 lines (ALREADY IMPLEMENTED)
  - SecurityLevel type and constants
  - SecurityLogEntry structure
  - CertificateInfo structure
  - SecurityLogger interface
  - DefaultSecurityLogger implementation
  - File-based logging functionality
  - JSON output formatting

## Current Status
**IMPORTANT**: This code has ALREADY been implemented by the SW Engineer in the parent split-002 directory.
This sub-split plan is for organizational purposes to manage the size violation.

## Size Analysis
- **Current Lines**: 370 lines (verified)
- **Limit**: 800 lines
- **Status**: COMPLIANT
- **Margin**: 430 lines available

## Functionality Implemented
1. **Security Levels**: INFO, WARNING, CRITICAL, BLOCKED
2. **Structured Logging**: JSON-formatted security events
3. **Certificate Info Tracking**: Subject, issuer, validity periods
4. **File-Based Persistence**: Rotating log files with timestamps
5. **Thread-Safe Operations**: Mutex-protected writes
6. **Configurable Output**: Multiple writers support

## Dependencies
- Standard library only (io, os, json, time, sync)
- No external dependencies

## Integration Points
- Used by: Split 002B (recommendations.go will use logger)
- Used by: Split 002C (tests will verify logger)

## Testing Requirements (To be done in Split 002C)
- Unit tests for all public methods
- Thread safety verification
- File rotation testing
- JSON format validation
- Error handling scenarios

## Implementation Instructions for Orchestrator
Since this code is ALREADY implemented:
1. **Option A - Keep as-is**: Accept the existing implementation in the parent directory
2. **Option B - Reorganize**: Move logger.go to a separate sub-directory/branch
3. **Recommendation**: Keep in parent directory, focus on getting 002B and 002C done

## Validation Checklist
- [x] File compiles independently
- [x] No external dependencies
- [x] Size under limit (370 < 800)
- [x] Interfaces properly defined
- [ ] Tests in Split 002C
- [ ] Integration with 002B verified

## Notes
- This split represents work already completed
- The violation occurred because recommendations.go grew larger than estimated
- Logger is self-contained and can work independently
