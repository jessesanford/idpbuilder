# Demo Granularity and Integration Requirements Fix Report

## Date: 2025-09-11
## Agent: Factory Manager

## üéØ Objective
Fix demo granularity requirements to ensure demos are only required at wave/phase/project integration levels (not effort level) and ensure integrations happen for ALL waves/phases regardless of effort/wave count.

## üìä Analysis Summary

### Current State Analysis
1. **R330 (Demo Planning Requirements)**: Previously required demos for "all effort plans" - too granular
2. **R291 (Integration Demo Requirement)**: Previously mentioned "effort/wave/phase/project" levels
3. **R009, R336**: Already correctly mandate wave integration for ALL waves
4. **R282**: Already correctly mandates phase integration even for single-wave phases
5. **R283**: Needed clarification for single-phase projects

### Key Findings
- ‚úÖ State machine has NO special cases for single-effort waves
- ‚úÖ R009 and R336 already mandate integration for EVERY wave
- ‚úÖ R282 already handles single-wave phases correctly
- ‚ùå R330 was requiring effort-level demos (fixed)
- ‚ùå R291 included effort-level in demo requirements (fixed)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è R283 needed clarification for single-phase projects (fixed)

## üîß Changes Made

### 1. R330 - Demo Planning Requirements
**Changed enforcement from**: "MANDATORY for all effort plans"
**Changed to**: "MANDATORY for all wave/phase/project integrations"

**Key updates**:
- Removed effort-level demo requirements
- Clarified demos only at integration points
- Added explicit notes that single-effort waves still need wave demos
- Added explicit notes that single-wave phases still need phase demos
- Emphasized integration demos can reuse effort functionality

### 2. R291 - Integration Demo Requirement
**Changed from**: "Every integration at EVERY level (effort/wave/phase/project)"
**Changed to**: "Every integration at wave/phase/project level"

**Key updates**:
- Removed effort level from demo requirements
- Added "(MANDATORY even for single-effort waves)" to wave section
- Added "(MANDATORY even for single-wave phases)" to phase section
- Added final note that effort-level demos are NOT required

### 3. R336 - Mandatory Wave Integration Before Next Wave
**Added critical clarification**:
- Single-effort waves STILL require integration
- Single-wave phases STILL require phase integration
- Number of efforts/waves does NOT affect integration requirements
- Integration and demos ALWAYS required at wave/phase/project levels

### 4. R283 - Project Integration Protocol
**Added mandatory section**:
- Single-phase projects STILL need project integration
- May duplicate phase integration but is MANDATORY
- Never skip thinking it's redundant

## ‚úÖ Requirements Now Satisfied

### Demo Granularity (FIXED)
- ‚ùå NO effort-specific demos required
- ‚úÖ Wave-level demos ALWAYS required (even for single-effort waves)
- ‚úÖ Phase-level demos ALWAYS required (even for single-wave phases)
- ‚úÖ Project-level demos ALWAYS required

### Integration Requirements (CONFIRMED)
- ‚úÖ Single-effort waves STILL get wave integration
- ‚úÖ Single-wave phases STILL get phase integration
- ‚úÖ Single-phase projects STILL get project integration
- ‚úÖ Demos required at EVERY integration level

## üéØ Edge Cases Handled

1. **Wave with 1 effort**:
   - Still needs wave integration branch
   - Still needs wave demo
   - Integration might be trivial (single merge) but MUST happen
   - Demo might reuse effort functionality but MUST exist

2. **Phase with 1 wave**:
   - Still needs phase integration branch
   - Still needs phase demo
   - Integration might duplicate wave integration but MUST happen
   - Demo might reuse wave demo content but MUST run

3. **Project with 1 phase**:
   - Still needs project integration branch
   - Still needs project demo
   - Integration might duplicate phase integration but MUST happen
   - Demo might reuse phase demo content but MUST run

## üìù Key Principles Established

1. **Integration is ALWAYS mandatory** - no exceptions based on content count
2. **Demos happen at integration points ONLY** - wave/phase/project levels
3. **Single-content integrations are still integrations** - must follow full process
4. **Redundancy is acceptable** - better to have duplicate integration than skip it
5. **Demos can be efficient** - reuse existing code, focus on proving integration works

## üöÄ Impact

### Positive Changes
- ‚úÖ Reduced demo overhead at effort level
- ‚úÖ Clear separation between effort work and integration validation
- ‚úÖ Consistent integration process regardless of content count
- ‚úÖ Predictable demo requirements at known integration points

### No Negative Impact
- All integrations still validated
- All demos still required at critical points
- Process remains consistent and auditable
- No loss of quality assurance

2. `/home/vscode/software-factory-template/rule-library/R291-integration-demo-requirement.md`

4. `/home/vscode/software-factory-template/rule-library/R283-project-integration-protocol.md`

## ‚úÖ Validation

All changes ensure:
- Demos only at integration points (wave/phase/project)
- Integration ALWAYS happens regardless of content count
- Clear rules with no ambiguity about edge cases
- Consistent with trunk-based development principles

## üéØ Result

**SUCCESS**: Demo granularity has been fixed to the appropriate level. Demos are now only required at integration points, but integration (and thus demos) are MANDATORY at every level regardless of how trivial the integration might seem.
