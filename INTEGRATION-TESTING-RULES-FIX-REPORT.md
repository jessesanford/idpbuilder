# INTEGRATION_TESTING State Rules Fix Report

**Date**: 2025-09-05  
**Fixed by**: Software Factory Manager  
**Issue**: Orchestrator blocked due to incorrect paths and rule references in INTEGRATION_TESTING state

## Problems Identified

### 1. Hardcoded Project Paths
- **Issue**: Rules contained hardcoded path `/home/vscode/software-factory-template`
- **Impact**: Rules would fail when orchestrator runs in different working directory (e.g., `/home/vscode/workspaces/idpbuilder-oci-go-cr`)
- **Fix**: Replaced all hardcoded paths with `$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR` environment variable

### 2. Incorrect Rule File Names
The following rule references pointed to non-existent files:

| Rule | Incorrect Reference | Correct File Name |
|------|-------------------|------------------|
| R271 | `R271-integration-testing.md` | `R271-mandatory-production-ready-validation.md` |
| R273 | `R273-production-ready-validation.md` | `R273-runtime-specific-validation.md` |
| R280 | `R280-never-merge-to-main.md` | `R280-main-branch-protection.md` |

### 3. Absolute Effort Paths
- **Issue**: Used absolute paths `/efforts/` for effort directories
- **Fix**: Changed to relative paths `efforts/` for better portability

## Changes Applied

### File Modified
`/home/vscode/software-factory-template/agent-states/orchestrator/INTEGRATION_TESTING/rules.md`

### Specific Changes

1. **R271 Rule Reference**:
   - Old: `R271 - Integration Testing` → `R271-integration-testing.md`
   - New: `R271 - Mandatory Production Ready Validation` → `R271-mandatory-production-ready-validation.md`

2. **R273 Rule Reference**:
   - Old: `R273 - Production Ready Validation` → `R273-production-ready-validation.md`
   - New: `R273 - Runtime Specific Validation` → `R273-runtime-specific-validation.md`

3. **R280 Rule Reference**:
   - Old: `R280 - Never Merge to Main` → `R280-never-merge-to-main.md`
   - New: `R280 - Main Branch Protection` → `R280-main-branch-protection.md`

4. **Path Replacements**:
   - All `/home/vscode/software-factory-template` → `$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR`
   - All `/efforts/` → `efforts/` (relative path)

## Verification Results

All referenced rule files confirmed to exist:
- ✅ `R271-mandatory-production-ready-validation.md`
- ✅ `R273-runtime-specific-validation.md`
- ✅ `R280-main-branch-protection.md`

## Impact

This fix allows the orchestrator to:
1. Correctly read INTEGRATION_TESTING state rules regardless of working directory
2. Access the correct rule files from rule-library
3. Work properly with project-agnostic paths
4. Continue with integration testing workflow

## Git Commit Details

- **Commit Hash**: 100068d
- **Branch**: main
- **Status**: Pushed to remote

## Recommendations

1. **Audit Other State Files**: Check all state rule files for similar hardcoded paths
2. **Update Templates**: Ensure state rule templates use `$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR`
3. **Add Validation**: Consider adding a script to validate all rule references in state files

## Resolution Status

✅ **RESOLVED** - All path and rule reference issues fixed and verified
