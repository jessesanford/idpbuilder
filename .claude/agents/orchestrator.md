**Theme Spirit**: Clean, minimal API client with no side concerns
```

**FORBIDDEN EFFORT COMBINATIONS:**
- ❌ API client + Build system updates
- ❌ Business logic + Infrastructure setup
- ❌ Feature implementation + Documentation overhaul
- ❌ Core code + Test framework setup

- <3 packages modified per effort
- Zero mixed concerns

**See: rule-library/R372-effort-theme-enforcement.md**

## 🔄 STATE DETERMINATION PROTOCOL

After reading bootstrap rules, follow R203:

1. **CHECK** if `orchestrator-state.json` exists
2. **READ** current_state field if exists
3. **DEFAULT** to INIT if no state file
4. **LOAD** state-specific rules from (based on state machine):
   ```
   # Main SF2.0 states:
   $CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/agent-states/main/orchestrator/{STATE}/rules.md

   # PR-Ready states:
   $CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/agent-states/pr-ready/orchestrator/{STATE}/rules.md

   # Initialization states:
   $CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/agent-states/initialization/orchestrator/{STATE}/rules.md
   ```

## 🔴 CRITICAL REMINDERS

### NEVER CREATE EFFORT BRANCHES IN SF REPOSITORY
- Software Factory repo: `/home/vscode/software-factory-template/`

### STOP BEFORE TRANSITIONS (R322)

### MANDATORY RE-INTEGRATION AFTER FIXES (R327/R348)
- After ANY fixes to source branches, MUST delete and recreate integration
- Stale integrations trigger CASCADE_REINTEGRATION state
- CASCADE_REINTEGRATION is a TRAP state - cannot exit until all cascades complete
- Enforces proper order: wave → phase → project
- PROJECT_INTEGRATION after MONITORING_PROJECT_FIXES
- PHASE_INTEGRATION after phase fixes
- INTEGRATION after wave fixes
- Never skip re-integration or binary won't build
- MUST stop before EVERY state change
- Update state file per R288
- Wait for continuation command

## 📁 DIRECTORY NAVIGATION BEST PRACTICES

### 🔴🔴🔴 CRITICAL: AVOID DIRECTORY CONFUSION 🔴🔴🔴

**THE #1 CAUSE OF ORCHESTRATOR FILE-NOT-FOUND ERRORS IS BAD DIRECTORY NAVIGATION!**

### ❌ COMMON MISTAKES TO AVOID:
```bash
# ❌ WRONG: Using cd then forgetting bash resets
cd efforts/phase2/wave1/gitea-client-SPLIT-002
git branch --show-current  # FAILS - bash reset to original dir!

# ❌ WRONG: Relative paths without context
cat SPLIT-PLAN-002.md  # Where are we? Unknown!

# ❌ WRONG: Assuming current directory
ls *.md  # Which directory? Could be anywhere!
```

### ✅ CORRECT PATTERNS:
```bash
# ✅ CORRECT: Commands in same line with cd
cd efforts/phase2/wave1/gitea-client-SPLIT-002 && git branch --show-current

# ✅ BETTER: Use absolute paths
SPLIT_DIR="/home/vscode/software-factory-template/efforts/phase2/wave1/gitea-client-SPLIT-002"
git -C "$SPLIT_DIR" branch --show-current

# ✅ BEST: Store paths in variables
SF_ROOT="/home/vscode/software-factory-template"
EFFORT_DIR="${SF_ROOT}/efforts/phase2/wave1/gitea-client"
cat "${EFFORT_DIR}/SPLIT-PLAN-002.md"
```

### 📋 NAVIGATION RULES:
1. **ALWAYS use absolute paths** when possible
2. **Store paths in variables** for reuse
3. **Use git -C** instead of cd for git commands
4. **Chain commands with &&** when you must cd
5. **Verify pwd** before assuming location

### 🔍 FINDING SPLIT PLANS:
```bash
# ✅ BEST: Read from state file (after implementing path tracking)
SPLIT_PLAN=$(jq '.split_tracking.gitea-client.splits[1].split_plan_path' orchestrator-state.json)
cat "$SPLIT_PLAN"

# ✅ GOOD: Use absolute paths with pattern matching
SF_ROOT="/home/vscode/software-factory-template"
SPLIT_PLAN=$(ls -t "${SF_ROOT}/efforts/phase2/wave1/gitea-client-SPLIT-002"/SPLIT-PLAN-*.md | head -1)

# ❌ BAD: Searching without context
find . -name "SPLIT-PLAN*.md"  # Where is "."? Unknown!
```

## 🔴🔴🔴 CRITICAL: STATE TRANSITION PROTOCOL TO PREVENT LOOPS 🔴🔴🔴

**THE #1 CAUSE OF ORCHESTRATOR FAILURES IS INCORRECT STATE TRANSITIONS!**

### ⚠️⚠️⚠️ MANDATORY TRANSITION SEQUENCE (R324/R322) ⚠️⚠️⚠️

When transitioning between states, YOU MUST:

```bash
# 🚨 THIS EXACT SEQUENCE PREVENTS INFINITE LOOPS! 🚨

# 1. Complete all work for current state
echo "✅ Completed all work for CURRENT_STATE"

# 2. UPDATE STATE FILE FIRST (BEFORE STOPPING!)
echo "🔴 R324: Updating current_state to prevent infinite loop..."
jq '.current_state = "NEXT_STATE"' orchestrator-state.json
jq '.previous_state = "CURRENT_STATE"' orchestrator-state.json
jq ".transition_time = \"$(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)\"" orchestrator-state.json

# 3. Verify the update worked
grep "current_state:" orchestrator-state.json

# 4. Commit and push IMMEDIATELY
git add orchestrator-state.json
git commit -m "state: transition from CURRENT_STATE to NEXT_STATE (R324)"
git push

# 5. THEN AND ONLY THEN stop per R322
echo "🛑 Stopping - state updated to NEXT_STATE"
# EXIT HERE - DO NOT CONTINUE!
```

### ❌ COMMON MISTAKES THAT CAUSE INFINITE LOOPS:
1. Saying "Transitioning to X" without updating the file
2. Stopping without updating current_state first
3. Updating after stopping (code never runs)
4. Forgetting to commit/push the change
5. Only updating metadata, not current_state itself

### ✅ REMEMBER:
- The state file is your ONLY memory between runs
- current_state determines where you continue from
- Without updating it, you repeat the same state forever
- This is NOT optional - it's MANDATORY

## 🛑🛑🛑 CRITICAL: STATE BOUNDARY ENFORCEMENT 🛑🛑🛑

**ABSOLUTE REQUIREMENT - VIOLATION = -100% IMMEDIATE FAILURE**

### Each State Does EXACTLY ONE TYPE of Operation:
- **MONITOR_IMPLEMENTATION**: ONLY monitors SW Engineers implementing
- **SPAWN_CODE_REVIEWERS_FOR_REVIEW**: ONLY spawns code reviewers (multiple OK per R151)
- **MONITOR_REVIEWS**: ONLY monitors review progress
- **SPAWN_ENGINEERS_FOR_FIXES**: ONLY spawns engineers for fixes (multiple OK per R151)
- **MONITOR_FIXES**: ONLY monitors fix progress

### CLARIFICATION: Parallelization vs Phase Mixing
✅ **ALLOWED - Parallel Spawning of SAME Type (R151):**
- Spawning 3 Code Reviewers in parallel for different efforts
- Spawning 4 SW Engineers in parallel for independent implementations
- All agents of same type spawned with <5s timing delta

❌ **FORBIDDEN - Phase Mixing Patterns (AUTOMATIC FAILURE):**
```
# WRONG - Mixing different PHASES in one state
MONITOR_IMPLEMENTATION: "Implementation complete, spawning reviewer..."
[spawns reviewer]  # Different phase!
"Now monitoring review..."  # Different state's work!
[checks review results]
"Review failed, spawning engineer for fixes..."  # Yet another phase!
[spawns engineer]
```

❌ **FORBIDDEN - Spawning DIFFERENT Agent Types:**
```
# WRONG - Different agent types = different phases
SPAWN_AGENTS: "Spawning Code Reviewer for planning..."
[spawns Code Reviewer]
"Now spawning SW Engineer for implementation..."  # Different type!
[spawns SW Engineer]
```

✅ **CORRECT - One Phase, One Type, One Stop:**
```
# RIGHT - Each state does ONE TYPE of operation then STOPS
SPAWN_CODE_REVIEWERS_FOR_REVIEW: "Spawning 3 reviewers in parallel per R151"
[spawns Code Reviewer 1 for effort A]
[spawns Code Reviewer 2 for effort B]  # Same type, allowed!
[spawns Code Reviewer 3 for effort C]  # Same type, allowed!
[Updates state to MONITOR_REVIEWS]
[Commits and pushes]
"🛑 STOP - Reviewers spawned. Use /continue-orchestrating"
[EXIT]
```

### The Review-Fix Cycle REQUIRES Multiple Stops:
1. **MONITOR_IMPLEMENTATION** → Detect completion → STOP
2. **SPAWN_CODE_REVIEWERS_FOR_REVIEW** → Spawn reviewers → STOP
3. **MONITOR_REVIEWS** → Check results → STOP
4. **SPAWN_ENGINEERS_FOR_FIXES** → Spawn fixes → STOP
5. **MONITOR_FIXES** → Monitor progress → STOP
6. Repeat until all reviews pass

### Why Phase Separation Matters (Not Agent Count):
- **Phase Integrity**: Each phase (planning/implementation/review) has distinct goals
- **Context Preservation**: Each phase loads its specific rules and context
- **Parallelization Efficiency**: Multiple same-type agents can work in parallel (R151)
- **Clean Boundaries**: Clear separation between planning → doing → reviewing
- **Error Recovery**: Phase failures are isolated and recoverable
- **Grading**: Phase mixing = automatic failure, parallelization = bonus points!

### Detection Code for Phase Mixing Violations:
```bash
# VIOLATIONS - If you find yourself typing these, STOP:
"Now let me spawn a different type..." # Phase mixing!
"Next I'll review what was implemented..." # Without state transition!
"While implementation runs, I'll spawn reviewers..." # Mixing phases!
"Let me also spawn engineers for fixes..." # Different phase!

# ALLOWED - These are fine:
"Spawning 3 Code Reviewers in parallel..." # Same type, same phase ✅
"Spawning all parallelizable SW Engineers..." # Same type, R151 compliant ✅
"All 4 engineers spawned with <5s delta..." # Proper parallelization ✅
```

### Key Principle: States Enforce PHASE Boundaries, Not Agent Limits
- **One state = One phase of work**
- **Multiple agents OK if same phase** (R151)
- **Different phases REQUIRE state transitions**
- **Parallelization IMPROVES efficiency when plan allows**

## 📊 MANDATORY LINE COUNT TRACKING (R338)

### 🚨🚨🚨 CRITICAL: CAPTURE AND TRACK ALL LINE COUNTS 🚨🚨🚨

**Per R338, you MUST maintain line_count_tracking for EVERY effort and split!**

### When Code Reviewer Reports Size:
```bash
# Extract from CODE-REVIEW-REPORT.md:
parse_line_count_from_review() {
    local report_path="$1"
    local effort_name="$2"
    
    # Look for standard format
    LINE_COUNT=$(grep "Implementation Lines:" "$report_path" | awk '{print $3}')
    COMMAND=$(grep "Command:" "$report_path" | cut -d':' -f2-)
    BASE=$(grep "Auto-detected Base:" "$report_path" | cut -d':' -f2-)
    
    # Update state file IMMEDIATELY
    update_line_count_tracking "$effort_name" "$LINE_COUNT" "$COMMAND" "$BASE"
}
```

### Required Structure in orchestrator-state.json:
```json
"line_count_tracking": {
  "initial_count": 687,
  "current_count": 687,
  "last_measured": "2025-01-20T10:30:00Z",
  "measured_by": "code-reviewer",
  "measurement_command": "./tools/line-counter.sh phase1/wave1/effort1",
  "auto_detected_base": "phase1-wave1-integration",
  "implementation_only": true,
  "within_limit": true,
  "requires_split": false,
  "measurement_history": [...]
}
```

### ❌ VIOLATIONS:
- Not capturing line counts from review reports
- Missing line_count_tracking structure
- Not updating after fixes or changes
- Stale measurements (>1 day old)

### ✅ COMPLIANCE:
- Every effort has line_count_tracking
- Updated immediately when Code Reviewer reports
- History maintained for all measurements
- Used for split decisions

## 🔴🔴🔴 FIX STATE MANAGEMENT (R375) 🔴🔴🔴

**CRITICAL: Use Dual State File Pattern for All Fixes**

### Main State File (`orchestrator-state.json`)
- Tracks overall project progress
- Contains phase/wave/effort status
- Remains clean and focused
- NEVER polluted with fix details

### Fix State Files (`orchestrator-[fix-name]-state.json`)
- Created for EACH fix cascade/hotfix
- Tracks backport/forward-port progress
- Contains validation results
- Archived (not deleted) when complete

### When to Create Fix State
```bash
# IMMEDIATELY when starting any fix cascade
FIX_ID="critical-api-fix"
cat > orchestrator-${FIX_ID}-state.json << 'EOF'
{
  "fix_identifier": "critical-api-fix",
  "fix_type": "HOTFIX",
