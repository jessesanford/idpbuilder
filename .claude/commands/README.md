## Command Usage Guidelines

### ðŸš¨ Critical Requirements

All commands enforce these mandatory requirements:

1. **Agent Identity Verification**: Commands verify agent identity matches expected role
2. **Environment Validation**: Working directory, Git branch, and remote tracking verification
3. **Line Count Compliance**: Every effort must be â‰¤800 lines using project line counter
4. **TODO State Management**: Proper save/load protocols during state transitions
5. **Pre-flight Checks**: Comprehensive startup verification for all agents

### ðŸ“‹ State Machine Integration

Commands are tightly integrated with the Software Factory 2.0 state machine:

- **State Detection**: Automatically detect current state from orchestrator-state.yaml
- **State Transitions**: Proper TODO saving before transitions
- **State Validation**: Ensure transitions follow valid state machine paths
- **Recovery Support**: Context recovery protocols for lost or corrupted state

### ðŸ”„ Context Recovery

All commands support context recovery after interruptions:

1. **Check for Compaction**: Automatic detection of Claude Code compaction
2. **TODO Recovery**: Load and merge saved TODO state files
3. **State Reconstruction**: Rebuild working context from persistent files
4. **Validation**: Verify recovered state is consistent and valid

### ðŸ“Š Project Agnostic Design

Commands use `[project]` placeholders for project-specific elements:

- `./agent-configs/[project]/` - Project configuration directory
- `./tools/[project]-line-counter.sh` - Project-specific line counting tool
- `[LANG]-sw-eng.md` - Language-specific agent configurations
- `PHASE{X}-SPECIFIC-IMPL-PLAN.md` - Phase-specific planning documents

## File Structure Requirements

For commands to work properly, projects should maintain this structure:

```
/workspaces/[project]/
â”œâ”€â”€ agent-configs/[project]/          # Project-specific agent configs
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ orchestrator-state.yaml      # State machine persistence
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ todos/                       # TODO state files
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ [PROJECT]-ORCHESTRATOR-IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN.md
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ SOFTWARE-ENG-AGENT-STARTUP-REQUIREMENTS.md
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ CODE-REVIEWER-COMPREHENSIVE-GUIDE.md
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ architect.md
â”œâ”€â”€ agent-states/                    # Agent state definitions
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ orchestrator/               # Orchestrator states
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ sw-engineer/                # SW Engineer states
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ code-reviewer/              # Code Reviewer states
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ architect/                  # Architect states
â”œâ”€â”€ state-machines/                 # State machine definitions
â”œâ”€â”€ tools/                         # Project-specific tools
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ [project]-line-counter.sh  # CRITICAL: Line counting tool
â””â”€â”€ efforts/                       # Implementation work directories
```

## Integration with Software Factory 2.0

These commands are designed to work seamlessly with:

- **State Machine Framework**: Multi-agent state management
- **Grading System**: Automated quality assurance
- **Rule Library**: Comprehensive rule enforcement 
- **Expertise Modules**: Domain-specific knowledge
- **Line Count System**: Size compliance enforcement
- **TODO Management**: Task persistence across interruptions

## Best Practices

### Command Selection
- Use agent-specific continuation commands for normal operations
- Use `/check-status` first when diagnosing issues
- Use `/reset-state` only when recovery is impossible
- Always verify agent identity before using commands

### State Management
- Save TODO state before major transitions
- Commit and push TODO files to preserve state
- Use proper state machine transitions
- Verify environment before proceeding

### Recovery Protocols
- Check for compaction markers on startup
- Load TODO state using TodoWrite tool (not just reading)
- Deduplicate recovered TODOs with existing ones
- Validate recovered state before proceeding

### Quality Assurance
- Never bypass line count measurements
- Always use project-specific line counter tool
- Enforce test coverage requirements
- Maintain proper documentation and work logs

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Agent Identity Mismatch**: Verify your prompt contains correct `@agent-*` designation
2. **Wrong Directory**: Commands check working directory - don't try to cd to fix
3. **Missing State Files**: Use `/check-status` to diagnose, `/reset-state` to recover
4. **TODO State Loss**: Follow compaction recovery protocol in commands
5. **Line Count Failures**: Ensure project line counter tool exists and is executable

### Emergency Procedures

1. **System Unresponsive**: Use `/check-status` for comprehensive diagnosis
2. **State Corruption**: Use `/reset-state` with appropriate level
3. **Agent Confusion**: Verify identity and re-read agent-specific configurations
4. **Context Loss**: Follow compaction recovery protocols automatically triggered
5. **Progress Loss**: Check backup branches and TODO state files

## Contributing

When modifying these commands:

1. Maintain project-agnostic design with `[project]` placeholders
2. Preserve all critical safety checks and validations
3. Keep state machine integration intact
4. Test with multiple project types
5. Update this documentation

These commands form the operational backbone of Software Factory 2.0, ensuring consistent, high-quality software development processes across all projects.
