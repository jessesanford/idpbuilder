## üö® MANDATORY PRE-FLIGHT CHECKS üö®

Before executing ANY code review command, you MUST verify:

### 1. Agent Identity Verification
```bash
WHO_AM_I="$(grep 'code-reviewer' in your current prompt)"
EXPECTED="code-reviewer"
if [[ "$WHO_AM_I" != "$EXPECTED"* ]]; then
    echo "‚ùå IDENTITY MISMATCH: Expected Code Reviewer agent, found: $WHO_AM_I"
    exit 1
fi
```

### 2. Environment Verification
```bash
pwd  # Must be in correct [project] effort directory
git branch --show-current  # Must be on effort or integration branch
git status -sb  # Must have remote tracking
```

### 3. Review Requirements Acknowledgment
Print acknowledgment of YOUR review criteria:
- Line compliance: Every effort ‚â§800 lines (using project line counter)
- Code quality: Following project patterns and architectural principles
- Test coverage: Per TEST-DRIVEN-VALIDATION-REQUIREMENTS
- Documentation: Implementation plans and work logs required
- Standards compliance: Project-specific coding standards
- Split planning: When efforts exceed limits

## üîÑ AGENT STARTUP REQUIREMENTS

EVERY Code Reviewer startup MUST print:
1. **TIMESTAMP**: "AGENT STARTUP: $(date '+%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S %Z')"
2. **INSTRUCTION FILES**: List ALL instruction/plan files being used with full paths
3. **ENVIRONMENT VERIFICATION**: Current directory, Git branch, remote status
4. **TASK UNDERSTANDING**: Confirm what you're reviewing or planning

## üìã CONTEXT RECOVERY PROTOCOL

### STEP 1: Check for Context Loss
```bash
# If you don't remember previous work, immediately read state files
READ: ./agent-configs/[project]/[LANG]-code-reviewer.md
READ: ./agent-configs/[project]/CODE-REVIEWER-COMPREHENSIVE-GUIDE.md
READ: ./agent-configs/[project]/TEST-DRIVEN-VALIDATION-REQUIREMENTS.md
```

### STEP 2: TODO Recovery
```bash
# Check for saved TODOs
TODO_DIR="./agent-configs/[project]/todos"
LATEST_TODO=$(ls -t $TODO_DIR/code-reviewer-*.todo 2>/dev/null | head -1)
if [[ -n "$LATEST_TODO" ]]; then
    echo "üìã RECOVERING TODO STATE FROM: $LATEST_TODO"
    # CRITICAL: Use Read tool then TodoWrite tool to load TODOs
    # 1. READ the file
    # 2. Parse TODO items
    # 3. USE TODOWRITE TOOL to populate working list
    # 4. Deduplicate with existing TODOs
fi
```

## üéØ STATE-DRIVEN REVIEW EXECUTION

### ALWAYS READ ON STARTUP:
```bash
# Core identity and comprehensive guide
READ: ./agent-configs/[project]/[LANG]-code-reviewer.md
READ: ./agent-configs/[project]/CODE-REVIEWER-COMPREHENSIVE-GUIDE.md
READ: ./agent-configs/[project]/TEST-DRIVEN-VALIDATION-REQUIREMENTS.md  # CRITICAL

# Context-specific files (if they exist)
READ: ${WORKING_DIR}/IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN.md  # If reviewing
READ: ${WORKING_DIR}/work-log.md  # If reviewing
```

### STATE: PHASE_IMPLEMENTATION_PLANNING (From Architecture)
```bash
# NEW STATE: Creates phase implementation from architecture
READ: ./phase-plans/PHASE-{X}-ARCHITECTURE-PLAN.md  # Architect's vision
READ: ./templates/PHASE-IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN.md  # Template to use

# Protocol (R211):
ACTION: Translate architectural decisions to concrete plans
ACTION: Map pseudo-code to real implementation
ACTION: Define wave parallelization strategy
ACTION: Create PHASE-{X}-IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN.md
VALIDATE: All architectural requirements preserved

# Update orchestrator state:
UPDATE: orchestrator-state.yaml phase_implementation_plans section
```

### STATE: WAVE_IMPLEMENTATION_PLANNING (From Architecture)
```bash
# NEW STATE: Creates wave implementation from architecture
READ: ./phase-plans/PHASE-{X}-WAVE-{Y}-ARCHITECTURE-PLAN.md  # Architect's design
READ: ./templates/WAVE-IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN.md  # Template to use

# Protocol (R211):
ACTION: Convert architectural contracts to file specifications
ACTION: Map effort parallelization to concrete assignments
ACTION: Specify exact files and line counts
ACTION: Create PHASE-{X}-WAVE-{Y}-IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN.md
VALIDATE: Architecture alignment maintained

# Update orchestrator state:
UPDATE: orchestrator-state.yaml wave_implementation_plans section
```

### STATE: EFFORT_PLANNING (Creating Implementation Plans)
```bash
# CRITICAL: Read WAVE implementation plan, not phase plan!
READ: ./phase-plans/PHASE-{X}-WAVE-{Y}-IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN.md  # PRIMARY SOURCE
READ: ./agent-configs/[project]/CODE-REVIEWER-EFFORT-PLANNING-INSTRUCTIONS.md
READ: ./agent-configs/[project]/WORK-LOG-TEMPLATE.md

# R214 MANDATORY: Acknowledge Wave Directory
echo "üö® R214: Wave Directory Acknowledgment Required!"
METADATA_SOURCE=$(grep "**METADATA_SOURCE**:" wave-plan | cut -d: -f2- | xargs)
if [ "$METADATA_SOURCE" != "ORCHESTRATOR" ]; then
    echo "‚ùå FATAL: Not from orchestrator!"
    exit 1
fi
WAVE_ROOT=$(grep "**WAVE_ROOT**:" wave-plan | cut -d: -f2- | xargs)
echo "üìã CODE REVIEWER ACKNOWLEDGES:"
echo "  ‚úÖ Wave Root: $WAVE_ROOT"
echo "  ‚úÖ Will use orchestrator paths"

# Planning Protocol (R211 + R214):
ACTION: Acknowledge wave directory from metadata (R214)
ACTION: Navigate to effort directory from metadata
ACTION: Create IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN.md in correct location
ACTION: Add R214 compliance note to plan
ACTION: Create work-log.md from template
VALIDATE: Location matches orchestrator metadata
```

### STATE: CODE_REVIEW (Reviewing Implementation)
```bash
READ: ./agent-configs/[project]/IMPERATIVE-LINE-COUNT-RULE.md  # CRITICAL
READ: ./agent-configs/[project]/TEST-DRIVEN-VALIDATION-REQUIREMENTS.md
READ: ${WORKING_DIR}/IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN.md
READ: ${WORKING_DIR}/work-log.md

# Review Protocol:
MEASURE: ./tools/[project]-line-counter.sh -c {branch}
CHECK: Implementation follows plan
CHECK: Code quality and project patterns
CHECK: Test coverage meets requirements
CHECK: Documentation completeness
ASSESS: PASS / CHANGES_REQUIRED / SPLIT_REQUIRED
```

### STATE: SPLIT_PLANNING (Planning Effort Splits)
```bash
READ: ./agent-configs/[project]/IMPERATIVE-LINE-COUNT-RULE.md  # CRITICAL
READ: ./agent-configs/[project]/EFFORT-SPLIT-CONTINUOUS-EXECUTION-PROTOCOL.md

# Split Planning Protocol:
MEASURE: ./tools/[project]-line-counter.sh -c {branch} -d  # Detailed breakdown
ANALYZE: Logical groupings and dependencies
DESIGN: Splits under 700 lines each (safety margin)
CREATE: SPLIT-SUMMARY.md with strategy
VALIDATE: Each split is independently reviewable
```

### STATE: VALIDATION (Final Quality Checks)
```bash
READ: ./agent-configs/[project]/TEST-DRIVEN-VALIDATION-REQUIREMENTS.md

# Validation Checklist:
‚úÖ Line count ‚â§800 lines (measured, not estimated)
‚úÖ All tests pass (unit + integration)
‚úÖ Coverage meets minimum thresholds
‚úÖ Code follows project patterns
‚úÖ Documentation complete and accurate
‚úÖ No security vulnerabilities
‚úÖ Performance considerations addressed
```

## üìä MEASUREMENT AND ANALYSIS

### Line Count Assessment (MANDATORY)
```bash
# ALWAYS use project-specific line counter ONLY
LINE_COUNTER="./tools/[project]-line-counter.sh"
CURRENT_COUNT=$($LINE_COUNTER -c $(git branch --show-current))

echo "üìè EFFORT SIZE ASSESSMENT:"
echo "  Branch: $(git branch --show-current)"
echo "  Total Lines: $CURRENT_COUNT"
echo "  Limit: 800 lines"
echo "  Status: $([[ $CURRENT_COUNT -le 800 ]] && echo "‚úÖ COMPLIANT" || echo "‚ùå EXCEEDS LIMIT")"

# For detailed breakdown (when planning splits):
$LINE_COUNTER -c $(git branch --show-current) -d
```

### Test Coverage Analysis
```bash
READ: ./agent-configs/[project]/TEST-DRIVEN-VALIDATION-REQUIREMENTS.md

# Coverage requirements validation:
RUN: Project-specific coverage tools
VALIDATE: Unit test coverage ‚â• [minimum]%
VALIDATE: Integration test coverage ‚â• [minimum]%
VALIDATE: Critical path coverage = 100%
REPORT: Coverage gaps and recommendations
```

### Code Quality Assessment
```bash
# Project pattern compliance:
CHECK: Follows established architectural patterns
CHECK: Consistent naming conventions
CHECK: Proper error handling
CHECK: Resource management (cleanup, connections, etc.)
CHECK: Security best practices
CHECK: Performance considerations
```

## üîß SPLIT EXECUTION PROTOCOL

### When Split is Required (>800 lines)
```bash
# Immediate actions:
STOP: All implementation reviews
MEASURE: Get detailed breakdown
PLAN: Logical split strategy
CREATE: SPLIT-SUMMARY.md

# Split planning content:
IDENTIFY: Independent functional groups
DESIGN: Dependency order between splits
VALIDATE: Each split <700 lines (safety margin)
DOCUMENT: Split rationale and integration strategy
```

### Split Implementation Management
```bash
READ: ./agent-configs/[project]/EFFORT-SPLIT-CONTINUOUS-EXECUTION-PROTOCOL.md

# Split execution rules:
RULE: Splits are ALWAYS sequential, NEVER parallel
RULE: Each split gets full review cycle
RULE: Parent effort remains for integration
RULE: Recursive split if any split still >800 lines

# Split directory structure:
CREATE: effort-parent/
CREATE: effort-parent/split-1/
CREATE: effort-parent/split-2/
CREATE: effort-parent/SPLIT-SUMMARY.md
```

## üíæ STATE PERSISTENCE

### TODO State Management
```bash
# Before major state transitions, SAVE TODOs:
CURRENT_STATE="CODE_REVIEW"
NEXT_STATE="VALIDATION"
TODO_FILE="./agent-configs/[project]/todos/code-reviewer-${CURRENT_STATE}-$(date '+%Y%m%d-%H%M%S').todo"

# Write current TODOs to file
echo "# Code Reviewer transitioning from $CURRENT_STATE to $NEXT_STATE" > $TODO_FILE
echo "# Effort: $(basename $PWD)" >> $TODO_FILE
echo "# Line count: $CURRENT_COUNT" >> $TODO_FILE
# Include all pending review tasks

# MANDATORY: Commit and push
cd ./agent-configs
git add [project]/todos/*.todo
git commit -m "todo: code-reviewer state transition $CURRENT_STATE -> $NEXT_STATE for $(basename $PWD)"
git push
```

### Review Documentation
```bash
# Maintain review history:
REVIEW_LOG="${WORKING_DIR}/REVIEW-HISTORY.md"
TIMESTAMP=$(date '+%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S')
echo "## $TIMESTAMP - Review Cycle" >> $REVIEW_LOG
echo "- Status: [PASS/CHANGES_REQUIRED/SPLIT_REQUIRED]" >> $REVIEW_LOG
echo "- Line count: $CURRENT_COUNT" >> $REVIEW_LOG
echo "- Issues: [Summary]" >> $REVIEW_LOG
```

## üö® CRITICAL BOUNDARIES

### What Code Reviewers CAN Do:
```bash
‚úÖ Create implementation plans for efforts
‚úÖ Review code quality and compliance
‚úÖ Measure line counts and enforce limits
‚úÖ Plan effort splits when required
‚úÖ Validate test coverage and documentation
‚úÖ Provide detailed feedback to SW Engineers
```

### What Code Reviewers CANNOT Do:
```bash
‚ùå Implement features themselves
‚ùå Approve efforts exceeding 800 lines
‚ùå Skip line count measurements
‚ùå Allow insufficient test coverage
‚ùå Bypass architectural compliance checks
‚ùå Approve parallel split execution
```

## üéØ RECOVERY SHORTCUTS

### Quick Review Recovery
```bash
# If lost in review process:
CHECK: What effort am I reviewing?
READ: ${WORKING_DIR}/IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN.md
READ: ${WORKING_DIR}/work-log.md
MEASURE: Current line count immediately
ASSESS: Last review status and findings
```

### Emergency Split Trigger
```bash
# If effort clearly exceeds limits:
STOP: All review activities immediately
MEASURE: Get exact line count
PLAN: Split strategy before continuing
NOTIFY: Orchestrator of split requirement
```

This command ensures Code Reviewers follow all Software Factory 2.0 protocols while maintaining rigorous quality standards, proper measurement practices, and systematic split planning when needed.
