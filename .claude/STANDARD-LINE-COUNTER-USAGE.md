# üö® STANDARD LINE COUNTER USAGE - ALL AGENTS MUST USE THIS PATTERN üö®

## The ONLY Correct Way to Find and Use the Line Counter

**ALL AGENTS (SW Engineer, Code Reviewer, Orchestrator) MUST use this exact pattern:**

```bash
# STEP 1: Find the project root (where orchestrator-state.yaml exists)
PROJECT_ROOT=$(pwd)
while [ "$PROJECT_ROOT" != "/" ]; do
    if [ -f "$PROJECT_ROOT/orchestrator-state.yaml" ]; then
        echo "Found project root at: $PROJECT_ROOT"
        break
    fi
    PROJECT_ROOT=$(dirname "$PROJECT_ROOT")
done

# STEP 2: Set the line counter path
LINE_COUNTER="$PROJECT_ROOT/tools/line-counter.sh"

# STEP 3: Verify it exists
if [ ! -f "$LINE_COUNTER" ]; then
    echo "‚ùå FATAL: Line counter not found at $LINE_COUNTER"
    exit 1
fi

# STEP 4: Run from YOUR effort directory with NO PARAMETERS
cd /path/to/your/effort/directory  # Be IN the effort directory
$LINE_COUNTER  # NO PARAMETERS - it auto-detects everything!
```

## Why This Pattern?

1. **Works from ANY directory** - Agents are in different effort directories
2. **No relative paths** - `./tools/` won't work since agents aren't in project root
3. **Finds project dynamically** - Works regardless of absolute path changes
4. **Single source of truth** - Tool is always at `PROJECT_ROOT/tools/line-counter.sh`

## What NOT to Do

‚ùå **NEVER use relative paths:**
```bash
./tools/line-counter.sh  # WRONG - only works from project root
```

‚ùå **NEVER look in outdated locations:**
```bash
$PROJECT_ROOT/tools/line-counter.sh  # WRONG - doesn't exist
```

‚ùå **NEVER use parameters for NORMAL efforts:**
```bash
$LINE_COUNTER -c branch-name  # WRONG for normal efforts - auto-detection works
```

‚úÖ **MUST use parameters for SPLIT efforts:**
```bash
$LINE_COUNTER -c "$(git branch --show-current)"  # CORRECT for splits
```

## Quick Copy-Paste Version

```bash
# For NORMAL efforts (finds project root and runs line counter)
PROJECT_ROOT=$(pwd); while [ "$PROJECT_ROOT" != "/" ]; do if [ -f "$PROJECT_ROOT/orchestrator-state.yaml" ]; then break; fi; PROJECT_ROOT=$(dirname "$PROJECT_ROOT"); done; $PROJECT_ROOT/tools/line-counter.sh

# For SPLIT efforts (searches up tree and uses branch parameter)
LC=$(d=$(pwd); while [ "$d" != "/" ]; do [ -f "$d/tools/line-counter.sh" ] && echo "$d/tools/line-counter.sh" && break; d=$(dirname "$d"); done); [ -n "$LC" ] && "$LC" -c "$(git branch --show-current)" || echo "Tool not found"
```

## Expected Output

```
Counting lines in phase1/wave1/your-effort (excluding generated code)...
Total non-generated lines: 456
```

## If Tool Not Found

If the line counter is not at `$PROJECT_ROOT/tools/line-counter.sh`:
1. The project setup is incomplete
2. Check if it exists at `$PROJECT_ROOT/utilities/line-counter.sh` 
3. Report the error and stop - don't proceed without proper measurement

## Remember

- **Project Root**: Where `orchestrator-state.yaml` exists
- **Tool Location**: Always `PROJECT_ROOT/tools/line-counter.sh`
- **Execution**: From YOUR effort directory
- **Parameters**: NONE (auto-detects branch and excludes generated code)
