# Orchestrator - MONITORING_EFFORT_FIXES State Rules


## 🛑🛑🛑 R322 MANDATORY STOP BEFORE STATE TRANSITIONS 🛑🛑🛑

**SUPREME LAW - VIOLATION = -100% IMMEDIATE FAILURE**

### YOU MUST STOP AFTER:
1. ✅ Completing all TODOs for this state
2. ✅ Updating orchestrator-state-v3.json with new state
3. ✅ Committing and pushing the state file  
4. ✅ Providing work summary

### YOU MUST NOT:

- ❌ Spawn agents for the new state
- ❌ Assume permission to continue

### STOP PROTOCOL:
```markdown
## 🛑 STATE TRANSITION CHECKPOINT: CURRENT_STATE → NEXT_STATE

### ✅ Current State Work Completed:
- [List completed work]

### 📊 Current Status:
- Current State: CURRENT_STATE
- Next State: NEXT_STATE
- TODOs Completed: X/Y
- State Files: Updated and committed ✅

### ⏸️ STOPPED - Awaiting User Continuation
Ready to transition to NEXT_STATE. Please use /continue-orchestrating.
```

**STOP MEANS STOP - Exit and wait for /continue-orchestrating**

## 🔴🔴🔴 R290 ENFORCEMENT: READ THESE RULES FIRST! 🔴🔴🔴

**SUPREME LAW #3 (R290): STATE RULES MUST BE READ BEFORE STATE ACTIONS**

## 🔴🔴🔴 STOP! STATE RULE READING IS ABSOLUTELY FIRST! 🔴🔴🔴

**YOU HAVE ENTERED MONITORING_EFFORT_FIXES STATE - YOU MUST READ AND ACKNOWLEDGE ALL STATE RULES BEFORE DOING ANY STATE WORK!**

## 🔴🔴🔴 R290 VERIFICATION REQUIREMENT 🔴🔴🔴

**R290 ENFORCEMENT: CREATE VERIFICATION MARKER AFTER READING**

After reading and acknowledging all state rules, you MUST create a verification marker:

```bash
# MANDATORY: Create verification marker after reading rules
touch .state_rules_read_orchestrator_MONITORING_EFFORT_FIXES
echo "$(date +%s) - Rules read and acknowledged for MONITORING_EFFORT_FIXES" > .state_rules_read_orchestrator_MONITORING_EFFORT_FIXES
```

**FAILURE TO CREATE MARKER = AUTOMATIC -100% PENALTY**

The system will check for this marker. No marker = Immediate failure.

### ❌ DO NOT DO ANY MONITORING_SWE_PROGRESS WORK UNTIL RULES ARE READ:
- ❌ Check fix progress for efforts
- ❌ Verify completion flags
- ❌ Check engineer processes
- ❌ Update state files
- ❌ Continue to next state
- ❌ Think about what to do in this state

### ✅ YOU MUST IMMEDIATELY:

## 🔴🔴🔴 MANDATORY STATE RULE READING AND ACKNOWLEDGMENT 🔴🔴🔴

### ⚠️⚠️⚠️ YOU MUST READ EACH RULE FILE LISTED IN PRIMARY DIRECTIVES. **I AM WATCHING YOUR TOOL CALLS FOR READ OPERATIONS** *YOU WILL FAIL* IF YOU DO NOT MAKE A READ FILE CALL FOR EACH RULE FILE IN PRIMARY DIRECTIVES!!! ⚠️⚠️⚠️

**AFTER READING, YOU MUST ACKNOWLEDGE ALL THE STATE RULES AND STATE THAT YOU WILL ABIDE BY THEM ONE AT A TIME GIVING THE RULE NUMBER AND DESCRIPTION.**

## 📋 PRIMARY DIRECTIVES FOR MONITORING_EFFORT_FIXES STATE

### Core Mandatory Rules (ALL orchestrator states must have these):

1. **🚨🚨🚨 R006** - ORCHESTRATOR NEVER WRITES CODE OR PERFORMS FILE OPERATIONS (BLOCKING)
   - File: `$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/rule-library/R006-orchestrator-never-writes-code.md`
   - Criticality: BLOCKING - Automatic termination, 0% grade
   - Summary: NEVER write, copy, move, or manipulate ANY code files - delegate ALL to agents

2. **🔴🔴🔴 R287** - TODO PERSISTENCE COMPREHENSIVE (SUPREME LAW)
   - File: `$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/rule-library/R287-todo-persistence-comprehensive.md`
   - Criticality: SUPREME - -20% to -100% penalty for violations
   - Summary: MUST save TODOs within 30s after write, every 10 messages, before transitions

3. **🔴🔴🔴 R288** - STATE FILE UPDATE REQUIREMENTS (SUPREME LAW)
   - File: `$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/rule-library/R288-state-file-update-and-commit-protocol.md`
   - Criticality: SUPREME - State updates required for all transitions
   - Summary: MUST update orchestrator-state-v3.json before EVERY state transition

4. **🔴🔴🔴 R322 Part A** - Mandatory Stop After Spawn States
   - File: `$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/rule-library/R322-mandatory-stop-before-state-transitions.md`
   - Criticality: SUPREME LAW - Must stop after spawning
   - Summary: ALL spawn states require STOP after spawning agents

### State-Specific Rules:

5. **🔴🔴🔴 R233** - Immediate Action On State Entry
   - File: `$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/rule-library/R233-all-states-immediate-action.md`
   - Criticality: SUPREME LAW - Must act immediately on entering state
   - Summary: All states are VERBS - take immediate action on entry


### PRIMARY DIRECTIVES - MANDATORY READING:

### 🛑 RULE R322 - Mandatory Stop Before State Transitions
**Source:** $CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/rule-library/R322-mandatory-stop-before-state-transitions.md
**Criticality:** 🔴🔴🔴 SUPREME LAW - Violation = -100% FAILURE

After completing state work and committing state file:
1. STOP IMMEDIATELY
2. Do NOT continue to next state
3. Do NOT start new work
4. Exit and wait for user

**WE ARE WATCHING EACH READ TOOL CALL**

### ❌ ANTI-PATTERNS THAT WILL CAUSE FAILURE:

1. **Fake Acknowledgment Without Reading**:
   ```
   ❌ WRONG: "I acknowledge R234, R208, R290..."
   (No Read tool calls detected = AUTOMATIC FAILURE)
   ```

2. **Bulk Acknowledgment**:
   ```
   ❌ WRONG: "I acknowledge all MONITORING_EFFORT_FIXES rules"
   (YOU Must READ AND ACKNOWLEDGE EACH rule individually)
   ```

3. **Silent Reading**:
   ```
   ❌ WRONG: [Reads rules but doesn't acknowledge]
   "Now I've read the rules, let me start work..."
   (MUST explicitly acknowledge EACH rule)
   ```

4. **Reading From Memory**:
   ```
   ❌ WRONG: "I know R008 requires monitoring progress..."
   (Must READ from file, not recall from memory)
   ```

5. **Skipping Rules in PRIMARY DIRECTIVES**:
   ```
   ❌ WRONG: Reading only some rules from the list
   (ALL rules in PRIMARY DIRECTIVES are MANDATORY)
   ```

### ✅ CORRECT PATTERN FOR MONITORING_EFFORT_FIXES:
```
1. READ: $CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/rule-library/R234-mandatory-state-traversal-supreme-law.md
2. "I acknowledge R234 - Mandatory State Traversal: [Brief description]"
3. READ: $CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/rule-library/R006-orchestrator-never-writes-code.md  
4. "I acknowledge R006 - Orchestrator Never Writes Code: [Brief description]"
[Continue for EVERY rule in PRIMARY DIRECTIVES...]
5. Create verification marker
6. "Ready to execute MONITORING_EFFORT_FIXES work"
```

### 🚨 NO WORK UNTIL ACKNOWLEDGMENT COMPLETE 🚨
**You may NOT begin ANY monitoring work until:**
1. ✅ ALL rules in PRIMARY DIRECTIVES have been READ
2. ✅ ALL rules have been individually ACKNOWLEDGED
3. ✅ Verification marker has been created
4. ✅ You have stated readiness to execute MONITORING_EFFORT_FIXES work

### 🚨 FAILURE TO READ STATE RULES FIRST = IMMEDIATE EXIT 🚨
**If you do ANY monitoring work before reading and acknowledging rules:**
- **STOP ALL WORK IMMEDIATELY**
- **EXIT WITH FAILURE STATUS**
- **YOU HAVE VIOLATED STATE COMPLIANCE**

## 🔴🔴🔴 SUPREME DIRECTIVE: MONITOR FIX IMPLEMENTATION PROGRESS 🔴🔴🔴

**TRACK ENGINEERS IMPLEMENTING FIXES AND VERIFY COMPLETION!**

## State Overview

In MONITORING_EFFORT_FIXES, you monitor Software Engineers implementing integration fixes and determine when all fixes are complete.

## Required Actions

### 1. Check Fix Progress for Each Effort
```bash
PHASE=$(echo "✅ State file updated to: $NEXT_STATE"
```

---

### ✅ Step 4: Validate State File (R324)
```bash
# Validate state file before committing
"$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/tools/validate-state.sh" orchestrator-state-v3.json || {
    echo "❌ State file validation failed!"
    exit 288
}
echo "✅ State file validated"
```

---

### ✅ Step 5: Commit State File (R288)
```bash
# Commit and push state file immediately
git add orchestrator-state-v3.json
git commit -m "state: MONITORING_EFFORT_FIXES → $NEXT_STATE - MONITORING_EFFORT_FIXES complete [R288]"
git push
echo "✅ State file committed and pushed"
```

---

### ✅ Step 6: Save TODOs (R287 - SUPREME LAW)
```bash
# Save TODO state before transition (R287 trigger)
save_todos "MONITORING_EFFORT_FIXES_COMPLETE"

# Commit TODOs within 60 seconds (R287)
cd "$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR"
git add todos/*.todo
git commit -m "todo: orchestrator - MONITORING_EFFORT_FIXES complete [R287]"
git push
echo "✅ TODOs saved and committed"
```

---

### ✅ Step 7: Output Continuation Flag (R405 - SUPREME LAW) ⚠️ MANDATORY
```bash
# Output continuation flag as LAST action (R405)
# Use TRUE for normal completion, FALSE only for catastrophic errors

echo "CONTINUE-SOFTWARE-FACTORY=TRUE"
```

**⚠️ THIS MUST BE THE ABSOLUTE LAST LINE OF OUTPUT BEFORE EXIT! ⚠️**

---

### ✅ Step 8: Stop Processing (R322 - SUPREME LAW)
```bash
# Stop for context preservation (R322)
echo "🛑 Stopping for context preservation - use /continue-orchestrating to resume"
exit 0
```

---

## 🚨 CHECKLIST ENFORCEMENT 🚨

**Skipping ANY step in this checklist = FAILURE:**
- Missing Step 2: No next state = stuck forever
- Missing Step 3: No state update = state machine broken (R288 violation, -100%)
- Missing Step 4: Invalid state = corruption (R324 violation)
- Missing Step 5: No commit = state lost on compaction (R288 violation, -100%)
- Missing Step 6: No TODO save = work lost (R287 violation, -20% to -100%)
- Missing Step 7: No continuation flag = automation stops (R405 violation, -100%)
- Missing Step 8: No exit = R322 violation (-100%)

**ALL 8 STEPS ARE MANDATORY - NO EXCEPTIONS**

## 🔴🔴🔴 R405 - MANDATORY AUTOMATION CONTINUATION FLAG 🔴🔴🔴

**SUPREME LAW - PENALTY FOR VIOLATION: -100% GRADE**


### 🚨 CRITICAL DISTINCTION: AGENT STOPS ≠ FACTORY STOPS 🚨

**TWO INDEPENDENT DECISIONS - DO NOT CONFUSE THEM:**

#### 1. Should Agent Stop Work? (R322 Technical Requirement)
- Agent completes current state
- Agent saves TODOs and commits state
- Agent exits with `exit 0` (preserves context)
- User runs /continue-orchestrating to resume
- **This is NORMAL at checkpoints**

#### 2. Should Factory Continue? (R405 Operational Status)
- Even though agent stopped, can automation proceed?
- TRUE = Healthy completion, automation can continue
- FALSE = Catastrophic failure, must halt everything
- **R322 checkpoints = TRUE (99.9% of cases)**

### THE PATTERN AT R322 CHECKPOINTS (SF 3.0)

```bash
# 1. Complete state work
echo "✅ State work complete"

# 2. Set proposed next state
PROPOSED_NEXT_STATE="NEXT_STATE"
TRANSITION_REASON="State work complete"

# 3. Spawn State Manager for state transition
/spawn state-manager SHUTDOWN_CONSULTATION \
  --current-state "CURRENT_STATE" \
  --proposed-next-state "$PROPOSED_NEXT_STATE" \
  --transition-reason "$TRANSITION_REASON"
# State Manager updates all 4 state files atomically

# 4. Save TODOs
save_todos "R322_CHECKPOINT"

# 5. Factory continues (operational status)
echo "CONTINUE-SOFTWARE-FACTORY=TRUE"

# 6. Agent stops (technical requirement)
exit 0
```

**Both happen together! Agent stops AND factory continues!**

### WHEN TO USE EACH FLAG VALUE

**TRUE (99.9%):**
- ✅ R322 checkpoint reached
- ✅ State work completed successfully
- ✅ Ready for /continue-orchestrating
- ✅ Waiting for user to continue (NORMAL)
- ✅ Plan ready for review (agent done, factory proceeds)

**FALSE (0.1%):**
- ❌ CATASTROPHIC unrecoverable error
- ❌ Data corruption spreading
- ❌ Critical security violation
- ❌ NOT for R322 checkpoints
- ❌ NOT for user review needs
### 🚨 MONITORING_SWE_PROGRESS STATE PATTERN - NORMAL TRANSITIONS 🚨

**Monitoring states transition to next actions automatically:**
```bash
# After monitoring completes
echo "✅ Monitoring complete, agents finished work"

# Determine next action from results
if all_succeeded; then
    transition_to "SPAWN_CODE_REVIEWERS_EFFORT_REVIEW"
elif needs_fixes; then
    transition_to "SPAWN_SW_ENGINEERS"
fi

# R322 checkpoint (if required by this transition)
echo "CONTINUE-SOFTWARE-FACTORY=TRUE"  # NORMAL operation!
exit 0  # If R322 checkpoint
```

**Why TRUE is correct:**
- Monitoring results drive automatic actions
- System knows what to do based on results
- **Review findings = Spawn fixes = NORMAL!**
**See: $CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/rule-library/R405-automation-continuation-flag.md**

- R239: Fix Plan Distribution Protocol
- R206: State Machine Transition Validation

## 🔴🔴🔴 MANDATORY MEASUREMENT RULE - R304 🔴🔴🔴

**ABSOLUTE REQUIREMENTS:**
- ✅ MUST use `$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/tools/line-counter.sh` for ALL line counting
- ❌ NEVER use `wc -l` or any manual counting method
- ❌ NEVER count lines any other way - this is a -100% automatic failure
- ✅ MUST specify both -b (base branch) and -c (current branch) parameters
- ✅ Base branch MUST be phase integration branch (NOT "main")

**Failure to use the line counter tool = AUTOMATIC -100% GRADE**

## R322 VIOLATION DETECTION

If you find yourself:
- Starting work for a new state without /continue-orchestrating
- Transitioning without stopping after state file commit
- Continuing after completing state work

**STOP IMMEDIATELY - You are violating R322!**


### 🔴🔴🔴 MANDATORY VALIDATION REQUIREMENT 🔴🔴🔴

**Per R288 and R324**: ALL state file updates MUST be validated before commit:

```bash
# After ANY update to orchestrator-state-v3.json:
"$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/tools/validate-state.sh" orchestrator-state-v3.json || {
    echo "❌ State file validation failed!"
    exit 288
}
```

**Use helper functions for automatic validation:**
```bash
# Source the helper functions
source "$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/utilities/state-file-update-functions.sh"

# Use safe functions that include validation:
safe_state_transition "NEW_STATE" "reason"
safe_update_field "field_name" "value"
```
