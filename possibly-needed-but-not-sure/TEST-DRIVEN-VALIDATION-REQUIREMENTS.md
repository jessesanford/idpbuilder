# Test-Driven Validation Requirements

## Overview
This document defines testing requirements for each phase of implementation. Customize coverage targets and testing strategies for your project.

## Coverage Requirements by Phase

### Phase 1: Foundation (Example: 90% Coverage)
- **Unit Tests**: Required for all public APIs
- **Integration Tests**: Required for component interactions
- **Coverage Target**: 90% for critical paths
- **Documentation**: API docs required

### Phase 2: Core Features (Example: 85% Coverage)
- **Unit Tests**: Required for business logic
- **Integration Tests**: Required for workflows
- **Coverage Target**: 85% overall
- **E2E Tests**: Key user journeys

### Phase 3: Extensions (Example: 80% Coverage)
- **Unit Tests**: Required for new features
- **Coverage Target**: 80% for new code
- **Performance Tests**: Baseline established

### Phase 4: Optimizations (Example: 75% Coverage)
- **Regression Tests**: No breaks in existing
- **Performance Tests**: Improvements validated
- **Coverage Target**: 75% maintained

### Phase 5: Polish (Example: 80% Coverage)
- **Full Test Suite**: All tests passing
- **E2E Coverage**: Complete user flows
- **Performance**: Meets requirements
- **Documentation**: Complete

## Test Implementation Requirements

### For Every Effort
```
MUST HAVE:
□ Unit tests for new code
□ Tests pass locally
□ No reduction in coverage
□ Clear test descriptions
```

### For Every Wave
```
MUST HAVE:
□ Integration tests for wave features
□ Coverage meets phase target
□ No flaky tests
□ Performance baseline maintained
```

### For Every Phase
```
MUST HAVE:
□ E2E tests for user journeys
□ Coverage target achieved
□ Performance requirements met
□ Test documentation complete
```

## Language-Specific Examples

### Go Testing
```go
// Table-driven tests required
func TestFeature(t *testing.T) {
    tests := []struct {
        name    string
        input   Type
        want    Type
        wantErr bool
    }{
        // Test cases
    }
    
    for _, tt := range tests {
        t.Run(tt.name, func(t *testing.T) {
            // Test implementation
        })
    }
}
```

### Python Testing
```python
# pytest with fixtures
import pytest

@pytest.fixture
def setup_data():
    return TestData()

def test_feature(setup_data):
    # Test implementation
    assert result == expected
```

### JavaScript/TypeScript Testing
```typescript
// Jest/Mocha with describes
describe('Feature', () => {
    beforeEach(() => {
        // Setup
    });
    
    it('should handle normal case', () => {
        expect(result).toBe(expected);
    });
    
    it('should handle error case', () => {
        expect(() => feature()).toThrow();
    });
});
```

## Coverage Measurement

### Running Coverage
```bash
# Go
go test -coverprofile=coverage.out ./...
go tool cover -html=coverage.out

# Python
pytest --cov=src --cov-report=html

# JavaScript/TypeScript
npm test -- --coverage
```

### Coverage Gates
- **Warning**: 5% below target
- **Error**: 10% below target
- **Block**: Any reduction in critical paths

## Test Categories

### Unit Tests
- Test individual functions/methods
- Mock external dependencies
- Fast execution (<100ms)
- Deterministic results

### Integration Tests
- Test component interactions
- Use real dependencies where possible
- Moderate execution time (<1s)
- Database/API integration

### E2E Tests
- Test complete user workflows
- Full system deployment
- Longer execution time acceptable
- Critical paths only

### Performance Tests
- Baseline measurements
- Load testing for scale
- Memory profiling
- Response time validation

## Review Criteria

### Code Reviewer Checks
- [ ] Tests exist for new code
- [ ] Tests are meaningful (not just coverage)
- [ ] Edge cases covered
- [ ] Error paths tested
- [ ] Tests are maintainable

### Architect Review Checks
- [ ] Testing strategy appropriate
- [ ] Coverage targets met
- [ ] Performance validated
- [ ] No test debt accumulation

## Customization Guide

### Adjusting Coverage Targets
Edit the phase requirements based on:
- Project criticality
- Team experience
- Timeline constraints
- Technical debt tolerance

### Adding Test Types
Consider adding:
- Security tests
- Accessibility tests
- Localization tests
- Chaos engineering tests

### Framework Selection
Choose based on:
- Language ecosystem
- Team familiarity
- CI/CD integration
- Reporting needs

## Important Notes

1. **Coverage is not everything** - Quality over quantity
2. **Test the behavior** - Not the implementation
3. **Keep tests simple** - Complex tests hide bugs
4. **Tests are documentation** - Make them readable
5. **Maintain test hygiene** - Delete obsolete tests
