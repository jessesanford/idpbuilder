## Size Analysis
- **Current Lines**: 35 lines (actual split-003 contribution)
- **Total Package Lines**: 1631 lines (entire pkg/push package)
- **Limit**: 800 lines
- **Status**: COMPLIANT
- **Requires Split**: NO

## 🔴 CRITICAL ISSUE: Implementation Already Completed Before Split

### Issue Description
The split-003 was supposed to implement operations.go (389 lines) as the main orchestration component. However, investigation shows:

1. **All code was already implemented** in commit `ffd3ab4 feat: implement core image push operations`
2. **Split-003 only added 1 import line**: `github.com/google/go-containerregistry/pkg/v1`
3. **The 35 lines counted** are mostly metadata files, not actual implementation

### Evidence
- operations.go: Already had 390 lines before split-003
- discovery.go: Already had 326 lines before split-003
- pusher.go: Already had 363 lines before split-003
- logging.go: Already had 249 lines before split-003
- progress.go: Already had 303 lines before split-003

Total: 1631 lines were already present before split-003 started

## Functionality Review
- ✅ Requirements implemented correctly (but in wrong effort/commit)
- ✅ All required structs and methods present
- ✅ Proper error handling implemented
- ✅ Code compiles successfully

## Code Quality
- ✅ Clean, readable code
- ✅ Proper variable naming
- ✅ Appropriate comments
- ✅ No code smells detected
- ⚠️ Several TODO comments found in existing code

## R355 Production Readiness Issues
Found the following violations:
1. **TODO Comments** in:
   - pkg/cmd/get/clusters.go (multiple TODOs)
   - pkg/cmd/get/packages.go
   - pkg/controllers/gitrepository/controller.go
   - pkg/util/idp.go

2. **Mock/Stub References** in test files (acceptable in tests):
   - Multiple test files use mock libraries (stretchr/testify/mock)
   - This is acceptable as they're in test files

3. **Credential Variables** (potential security concern):
   - pkg/push/operations.go references password/username from flags
   - pkg/controllers/gitrepository/gitea.go checks password
   - These appear to be legitimate usage but should be reviewed for security

## Test Coverage
- **Unit Tests**: Not implemented in this split
- **Integration Tests**: Not implemented in this split
- **Test Quality**: N/A - No tests in split

## Pattern Compliance
- ✅ Go patterns followed
- ✅ Error handling patterns correct
- ✅ Package structure appropriate

## Security Review
- ⚠️ Credential handling needs review
- ✅ No hardcoded secrets found
- ✅ TLS configuration allows insecure mode (by design)

## Issues Found
1. **CRITICAL: Split-003 didn't actually implement the code** - The implementation was done in the original effort before splitting
2. **CASCADE VIOLATION**: The R509 report shows split-002 was not implemented, breaking the cascade
3. **TODO comments** present in production code (R355 violation)
4. **No tests** implemented in this split

## Recommendations
1. **IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED**: The split structure is broken
   - Split-001 and Split-002 were never properly implemented
   - All code was implemented in the original effort
   - This violates the split protocol

2. **CASCADE REPAIR NEEDED**:
   - Split-002 needs to be implemented before split-003 can be valid
   - The current implementation doesn't follow the cascade pattern

3. **TODO CLEANUP**: Remove or address TODO comments before production

## Next Steps
**NEEDS_FIXES**: Major structural issues need to be addressed:
1. The split implementation is invalid - all code was done before splitting
2. CASCADE violation needs to be fixed (split-002 must be implemented first)
3. TODO comments should be addressed
4. Tests should be added

## Grading Impact
- **-50%**: Accepting implementation that violates CASCADE (R509)
- **-30%**: TODO comments in production code (R355)
- **-20%**: No test coverage
