# SOFTWARE FACTORY 2.0 IMPLEMENTATION PLAN: IDPBuilder OCI Management
## Solving the Gitea Self-Signed Certificate Problem

**Project Name**: idpbuilder-oci-mvp  
**Timeline**: 2 weeks (10 business days)  
**Start Date**: TBD  
**Primary Goal**: Enable reliable image push to Gitea with self-signed certificates  
**Success Metric**: Zero certificate errors during normal operation  
**Framework Version**: Software Factory 2.0 (Latest Rules Applied)  

## Executive Summary

This MVP implementation plan focuses exclusively on solving the self-signed certificate problem that prevents reliable OCI image operations with the builtin Gitea instance. By prioritizing certificate handling and basic build/push functionality, we can deliver immediate value in 2 weeks.

## üî¥üî¥üî¥ CRITICAL SOFTWARE FACTORY 2.0 RULES üî¥üî¥üî¥

### SUPREME LAWS (Violation = Automatic Failure)
- **R006**: Orchestrator NEVER writes code - only coordinates
- **R319**: Orchestrator NEVER measures code - Code Reviewers measure ALWAYS
- **R320**: NO stub implementations - all code must be functional
- **R321**: Immediate backport during integration - no deferred fixes
- **R322**: Mandatory stop at state transitions - no automatic flow
- **R323**: Must build final artifact - no "code-only" completion
- **R151**: Parallel agents spawn with <5s timestamps
- **R283**: Project-level integration is MANDATORY

### Role Clarifications
- **Orchestrator**: ONLY coordinates, spawns agents, manages state (never writes/measures)
- **Code Reviewer**: Plans efforts, MEASURES ALL CODE, validates, detects stubs
- **SW Engineer**: Implements features, fixes issues, builds artifacts
- **Architect**: Reviews wave/phase completions, provides guidance
- **Integration Agent**: Merges branches (READ-ONLY for code)

## üéØ Critical Workflow Corrections

### State Machine Flow (Per Latest Rules)
1. **Wave Integration ‚Üí Phase Integration ‚Üí PROJECT Integration** (R283 mandatory)
2. **Immediate backport during integration** (R321 - no deferred fixes)
3. **Build validation includes final artifact** (R323 required)
4. **Mandatory stops at every state transition** (R322)
5. **Parallel spawning with <5s timestamps** (R151)

### Effort Planning Protocol
1. **Code Reviewers create effort plans** (not orchestrators)
2. **Code Reviewers measure ALL code** (R319 - orchestrators NEVER measure)
3. **Code Reviewers detect stubs** (R320 - must reject)
4. **Split planning when >700 lines (soft) or >800 lines (hard)**
5. **Each effort must be independently mergeable**

### Integration Protocol (R321 Compliance)
1. **Integration branches are READ-ONLY** (merges only)
2. **ANY fix needed ‚Üí immediate backport to source**
3. **No fixes in integration branches**
4. **Re-run full integration after fixes**
5. **All source branches must build independently**

### Agent Interaction Protocol

#### Spawn Sequence with State Machine
```
Orchestrator States:
INIT ‚Üí WAVE_START ‚Üí SETUP_EFFORT_INFRASTRUCTURE
  ‚Üí ANALYZE_CODE_REVIEWER_PARALLELIZATION (R234 mandatory)
  ‚Üí SPAWN_CODE_REVIEWERS_EFFORT_PLANNING (R151 timing)
  ‚Üí WAITING_FOR_EFFORT_PLANS
  ‚Üí ANALYZE_IMPLEMENTATION_PARALLELIZATION (R234 mandatory)  
  ‚Üí SPAWN_AGENTS (R151 timing)
  ‚Üí MONITOR_IMPLEMENTATION
  ‚Üí SPAWN_CODE_REVIEWERS_FOR_REVIEW (when complete)
  ‚Üí MONITOR_REVIEWS
  ‚Üí WAVE_COMPLETE (only if all pass)
  ‚Üí INTEGRATION
  ‚Üí [R322: STOP at each transition]
```

#### Communication Rules
1. Agents communicate via files and git operations
2. No direct agent-to-agent communication
3. Orchestrator manages all agent spawning
4. State transitions recorded in orchestrator-state.json
5. All decisions documented in appropriate logs

### Critical Gates and Enforcement

#### Wave Completion Gate
Before proceeding to next wave:
- ‚úÖ Code Reviewer confirmed all efforts < 800 lines (R319)
- ‚úÖ No stub implementations detected (R320)
- ‚úÖ All tests passing with required coverage
- ‚úÖ Wave integration branch created
- ‚úÖ All source branches verified working (R321)
- ‚úÖ Architect review completed
- ‚úÖ State file updated and committed (R288)
- ‚úÖ Orchestrator STOPPED at transition (R322)

#### Phase Transition Gate
Before starting new phase:
- ‚úÖ All waves in phase integrated
- ‚úÖ Phase integration branch created (merges only - R321)
- ‚úÖ Architect phase assessment complete
- ‚úÖ No OFF_TRACK status from architect
- ‚úÖ All documentation updated
- ‚úÖ Source branches independently buildable (R321)
- ‚úÖ Orchestrator STOPPED at transition (R322)

#### Size Enforcement Gate (Code Reviewer Responsibility)
When Code Reviewer detects > 800 lines:
- üõë Code Reviewer marks as SIZE_VIOLATION
- üìä Code Reviewer measures with line-counter.sh (R319)
- üìã Code Reviewer creates split plan
- üèóÔ∏è Orchestrator creates split infrastructure (R204)
- ‚úÇÔ∏è Execute splits sequentially (never parallel)
- üîÑ Each split gets full review cycle
- ‚ùå Orchestrator NEVER measures (R319)

### Grading Metrics Summary

**Overall System Success Requires**:
- 100% of efforts < 800 lines (measured with official tool)
- 100% of efforts reviewed and approved
- 100% test coverage requirements met
- Zero false positive STOP decisions
- Zero code written by Orchestrator
- All phase dependencies respected
- Clean integration at all levels

## Resource Allocation

### Team Structure
- **Orchestrator**: 1 (coordinates all work)
- **SW Engineers**: 3 (can be spawned as needed)
- **Code Reviewer**: 1 (reviews all code)
- **Architect**: 1 (system-wide authority)
- **Integration Agent**: 1 (manages branches)

### Review Points
- Every effort completion: Code review
- Every wave completion: Architecture review
- Every phase completion: Phase assessment
- Before main merge: Final integration review

## Success Criteria

### Primary Success Definition (R323 Compliance)
**SUCCESS** means delivering a **fully functional, buildable idpbuilder binary** that:
1. ‚úÖ **Compiles successfully** into an executable binary (`go build` produces `idpbuilder`)
2. ‚úÖ **Binary artifact exists** at specified path (R323 mandatory)
3. ‚úÖ **`idpbuilder build` command works** - assembles OCI image tarball from a context directory
4. ‚úÖ **`idpbuilder push` command works** - pushes images to Gitea registry  
5. ‚úÖ **Certificate handling works automatically** - no manual cert configuration needed
6. ‚úÖ **Zero certificate errors during normal operation** - the core problem is SOLVED
7. ‚úÖ **No stub implementations** - all functionality complete (R320)
8. ‚úÖ **All fixes in source branches** - no integration-only fixes (R321)

### Must Pass (Critical Requirements)
1. ‚úÖ **Buildable Binary**: `go build ./cmd/idpbuilder` produces working executable
2. ‚úÖ **Working `build` Command**: Can assemble OCI image tarballs from context directories without errors
3. ‚úÖ **Working `push` Command**: Can push to Gitea without certificate failures
4. ‚úÖ **Automatic Certificate Extraction**: Detects and extracts Gitea certs from Kind
5. ‚úÖ **Certificate Trust Configuration**: Configures go-containerregistry transport to trust Gitea's self-signed cert
6. ‚úÖ **--insecure Flag**: Fallback option works when explicitly requested
7. ‚úÖ **Clear Error Messages**: Certificate problems are clearly identified
8. ‚úÖ **Cross-platform**: Works on Linux and Mac

### Should Pass (Quality Requirements)
1. ‚≠ï **Test Coverage**: 80% coverage on all code
2. ‚≠ï **Build Performance**: Completes in < 2 minutes
3. ‚≠ï **Push Performance**: Completes in < 1 minute  
4. ‚≠ï **Certificate Rotation**: Handles cert updates gracefully
5. ‚≠ï **Integration Tests**: Full end-to-end tests pass
6. ‚≠ï **Documentation**: README with clear usage instructions

### Nice to Have (Future Enhancements)
1. ‚ûñ Windows support
2. ‚ûñ Multiple registry support
3. ‚ûñ Build cache optimization
4. ‚ûñ Progress bars and pretty output
5. ‚ûñ Verbose debugging mode

### Validation Checklist
The MVP is complete when a user can:
- [ ] Install the idpbuilder binary
- [ ] Run `idpbuilder create --with-gitea` successfully
- [ ] Run `idpbuilder build --context ./app --tag myapp:v1` successfully
- [ ] Run `idpbuilder push myapp:v1` successfully
- [ ] Confirm NO certificate errors occurred
- [ ] Confirm the image is visible in Gitea registry

## Risk Mitigation

### Risk 1: Kind Certificate Extraction Fails
**Mitigation**: Implement manual cert import as fallback
```bash
idpbuilder cert import --file /path/to/cert.pem
```

### Risk 2: Custom CA file permissions for TLS trust
**Mitigation**: Store CA at `~/.idpbuilder/certs/gitea.pem`, ensure readable by the process, and load via `tls.Config.RootCAs`; provide `--insecure` fallback only when explicitly requested

### Risk 3: Gitea API Changes
**Mitigation**: Test against multiple Gitea versions, use stable API endpoints

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests (Per Effort)
- Minimum 80% coverage
- Mock external dependencies
- Test error conditions
- Test edge cases

### Integration Tests (End of Each Phase)
- Real Kind cluster
- Real Gitea instance
- Real certificates
- Full workflow validation

### Manual Testing Checklist
- [ ] Fresh install works
- [ ] Cert extraction successful
- [ ] Build completes without errors
- [ ] Push succeeds with proper cert
- [ ] --insecure flag works
- [ ] Error messages are clear
- [ ] Cert rotation handled

## Rollout Plan

### Week 1 Deliverable
- Working certificate extraction
- Registry TLS trust integration

go install github.com/jessesanford/idpbuilder@mvp

# 2. Start IDPBuilder with Gitea
idpbuilder create --with-gitea

# 3. Assemble an image (certs handled automatically during push!)
idpbuilder build --context ./app --tag myapp:v1

# 4. Push to Gitea (no cert errors!)
idpbuilder push myapp:v1

# That's it! No manual certificate configuration needed!
```
