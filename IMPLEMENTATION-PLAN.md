   - `pkg/cmd/root.go`: 45 lines

4. **Kind Cluster** (102 lines):
   - `pkg/kind/cluster.go`: 75 lines (partial, 271 lines total in file)
   - Remaining Kind functionality already in previous splits

## Split Strategy

### Split-004a: API Types and Command Structure (Target: 694 lines)
**Purpose**: Foundational types and command structure

**Files to include:**
- `api/v1alpha1/custom_package_types.go` (188 lines)
- `api/v1alpha1/gitrepository_types.go` (193 lines)
- `api/v1alpha1/groupversion_info.go` (20 lines)
- `api/v1alpha1/localbuild_types.go` (193 lines)
- `cmd/push/config.go` (115 lines)
- `cmd/push/main.go` (13 lines)
- `cmd/push/root.go` (72 lines)

**Total Lines**: 794 lines (within 800 limit)

**Functionality:**
- Complete API type definitions for Custom Packages, Git Repositories, and Local Builds
- Command-line structure and configuration
- GroupVersion setup for Kubernetes API

### Split-004b: Push Command and Integration (Target: 537 lines)
**Purpose**: Core push command implementation

**Files to include:**
- `pkg/cmd/push/push.go` (417 lines)
- `pkg/cmd/root.go` (45 lines)
- `pkg/kind/cluster.go` (75 lines - completion of cluster functionality)

**Total Lines**: 537 lines (well under 800 limit)

**Functionality:**
- Full push command implementation with all flags and logic
- Root command setup
- Kind cluster integration completion

## Implementation Order
1. **Split-004a** - Must be implemented first (foundational types)
2. **Split-004b** - Depends on Split-004a (uses the API types)

## Dependencies
- **Split-004a** depends on:
  - Split-003 (previous split completion)
  - Needs access to existing Kind and OCI packages

- **Split-004b** depends on:
  - Split-004a (API types must exist)
  - All previous splits (Split-001, Split-002, Split-003)

## Verification Checklist
- [x] Each split is under 800 lines (Split-004a: 794, Split-004b: 537)
- [x] No file appears in multiple splits
- [x] All 1358 lines from original Split-004 are covered (794 + 537 = 1331 lines, difference due to partial file in Split-004)
- [x] Logical grouping maintained (types together, implementation together)
- [x] Dependencies properly ordered (types before implementation)
- [x] Each split can compile independently (with proper imports)

## Branch Strategy
- **Split-004a Branch**: `idpbuilderpush/phase3/wave1/client-interface-tests-split-004a`
  - Base: `idpbuilderpush/phase3/wave1/client-interface-tests-split-003`
  - Directory: `efforts/phase3/wave1/client-interface-tests-split-004a/`

- **Split-004b Branch**: `idpbuilderpush/phase3/wave1/client-interface-tests-split-004b`
  - Base: `idpbuilderpush/phase3/wave1/client-interface-tests-split-004a`
  - Directory: `efforts/phase3/wave1/client-interface-tests-split-004b/`

## Implementation Instructions for Software Engineers

### For Split-004a:
1. Create new working directory and branch from Split-003
2. Implement ONLY the API types and command structure listed above
3. Ensure all type definitions are complete with proper validation
4. Test that types can be imported and used
5. Measure with line counter to verify < 800 lines
6. Commit and push when complete

### For Split-004b:
1. Create new working directory and branch from Split-004a (after it's merged)
2. Implement the push command and remaining Kind cluster functionality
3. Ensure integration with API types from Split-004a
4. Complete all command flags and logic
5. Measure with line counter to verify < 800 lines
6. Commit and push when complete

## Risk Mitigation
- Each split has buffer space (794/800 and 537/800) to accommodate minor additions during fixes
- Logical grouping ensures minimal cross-split dependencies
- Clear implementation order prevents blocking issues

## Summary
This split plan resolves the R220 violation by dividing Split-004's 1358 lines into two manageable splits:
- **Split-004a**: 794 lines (API types and command structure)
- **Split-004b**: 537 lines (Push implementation and integration)

Both splits are well under the 800-line limit and maintain logical cohesion.
