# R340 Enforcement Report - Planning File Metadata Tracking

## Summary
Successfully enforced R340 (Planning File Metadata Tracking) across all agent state files to eliminate plan searching violations.

## Critical Violations Fixed

### SW Engineer Agent
1. **INIT State** (/agent-states/sw-engineer/INIT/rules.md)
   - BEFORE: Used `find` and `ls` to search for IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN files
   - AFTER: Reads plan location from orchestrator-state.json using jq/yq
   - Lines modified: 30-130 (complete rewrite of Step 1)

2. **SPLIT_IMPLEMENTATION State** (/agent-states/sw-engineer/SPLIT_IMPLEMENTATION/rules.md)
   - BEFORE: Used `find` to search for SPLIT-PLAN files
   - AFTER: Reads split plan location from state file
   - Lines modified: 207-265 (infrastructure verification section)

3. **FIX_ISSUES State** (/agent-states/sw-engineer/FIX_ISSUES/rules.md)
   - BEFORE: Used `ls` to find SPLIT-PLAN files for archiving
   - AFTER: Notes that plans are tracked per R340
   - Lines modified: 904-915

4. **MEASURE_SIZE State** (/agent-states/sw-engineer/MEASURE_SIZE/rules.md)
   - BEFORE: Used `ls SPLIT-PLAN-*.md` to detect split efforts
   - AFTER: Uses directory name pattern to detect splits
   - Lines modified: 16, 153

### Code Reviewer Agent
1. **EFFORT_PLAN_CREATION State** (/agent-states/code-reviewer/EFFORT_PLAN_CREATION/rules.md)
   - BEFORE: Had `find_latest_plan()` function with `find` commands
   - AFTER: Shows R340-compliant `get_plan_from_state()` function
   - Lines modified: 270-299

2. **CREATE_SPLIT_PLAN State** (/agent-states/code-reviewer/CREATE_SPLIT_PLAN/rules.md)
   - BEFORE: Used `find` to verify split plans existed
   - AFTER: Trusts inventory and reminds about R340 tracking
   - Lines modified: 194-199, 455, 698

### Orchestrator Agent
1. **CREATE_NEXT_SPLIT_INFRASTRUCTURE State** (/agent-states/orchestrator/CREATE_NEXT_SPLIT_INFRASTRUCTURE/rules.md)
   - BEFORE: Used `ls -t` to find split plans
   - AFTER: Reads split plan location from state file
   - Lines modified: 438-472

## R340 Compliance Features Added

### For All Agents
- Added R340 rule description at the beginning of affected state files
- Emphasized BLOCKING criticality of violations
- Clear examples of correct vs incorrect behavior

### For SW Engineers
```bash
# Correct R340-compliant approach:
PLAN_PATH=$(jq -r ".planning_files.effort_plans[\"${EFFORT_NAME}\"].file_path" orchestrator-state.json)

# Wrong approach (R340 violation):
find .software-factory -name "IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN*.md"  # NEVER DO THIS!
```

### For Code Reviewers
- Must report all created plans to orchestrator for tracking
- Standard reporting format included in state files

### For Orchestrator
- Must track all planning files in orchestrator-state.json
- Must update tracking when plans are moved or archived

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Verify No Search Commands Remain**:
   ```bash
   grep -r "find.*PLAN\|ls.*PLAN" agent-states/ | grep -v "R340\|WRONG\|violation"
   ```

2. **Verify State File Parsing**:
   - All agents use jq or yq to read from orchestrator-state.json
   - Proper error handling when plan not tracked

3. **Integration Test**:
   - Code Reviewer creates plan and reports it
   - Orchestrator updates state file
   - SW Engineer reads plan location from state file

## Impact
- Eliminates plan discovery failures
- Prevents integration delays
- Ensures consistent plan tracking across all agents
- Supports recovery after context loss
