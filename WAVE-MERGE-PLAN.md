# Phase 2 Wave 1 Integration Merge Plan

## ðŸŽ‰ UPDATE: Split-002 Successfully Rebased - Integration Simplified!

**Key Change**: `gitea-client-split-002` has been successfully rebased onto the current `gitea-client-split-001`, creating a clean linear history. This dramatically simplifies the integration process - what was previously a complex merge is now straightforward!

## Summary
This plan outlines the merge sequence for integrating Phase 2 Wave 1 efforts into the integration branch.

**Created**: 2025-01-15
**Updated**: 2025-01-15 (Split-002 rebase completed)
**Created By**: Code Reviewer Agent (WAVE_MERGE_PLANNING state)
**Target Branch**: `idpbuilder-oci-build-push/phase2/wave1/integration`
**Base Branch**: `idpbuilder-oci-build-push/phase1/integration`
**Integration Directory**: `/home/vscode/workspaces/idpbuilder-oci-build-push/efforts/phase2/wave1/integration-workspace/repo`

### Integration Complexity: âœ… REDUCED
- **Before**: Complex merge required for split-002 (based on old split-001)
- **After**: Simple, clean merges for all branches (linear history achieved)

## Critical Requirements (R269, R270)
- âœ… Use ONLY original effort branches (no integration branches)
- âœ… Exclude parent 'too-large' branches for split efforts
- âœ… Include only split branches for efforts that were split
- âœ… Determine merge order based on dependencies
- âœ… Document conflict resolution strategies

## Branches to Integrate

### Original Effort Branches (per R269/R270)
1. **image-builder**: `idpbuilder-oci-build-push/phase2/wave1/image-builder`
   - Status: Ready for merge
   - Size: Within limits (no splits needed)
   - Base: phase1/integration (with rebase completed)
   - Last commit: 8c68910 (marker: feature flag fix complete)

2. **gitea-client-split-001**: `idpbuilder-oci-build-push/phase2/wave1/gitea-client-split-001`
   - Status: Split from original gitea-client (too large)
   - Size: Within limits after split
   - Base: phase1/integration (rebased)
   - Last commit: 4fb2931 (marker: rebase onto phase1/integration complete)

3. **gitea-client-split-002**: `idpbuilder-oci-build-push/phase2/wave1/gitea-client-split-002`
   - Status: Second split of gitea-client
   - Size: Within limits
   - Base: **UPDATED** - Now rebased onto CURRENT split-001 (commit 4fb2931)
   - Last commit: Updated with cherry-picked fixes from split-001
   - Contains commits: 4aeb3ec, 2a407b7, 1304ef9 (cherry-picked versions of split-001's recent fixes)

### Excluded Branches
- **gitea-client**: `idpbuilder-oci-build-push/phase2/wave1/gitea-client`
  - Reason: Original effort exceeded size limits, replaced by splits
  - Status: DO NOT MERGE (parent branch of splits)

## Dependency Analysis

### Branch Relationships
1. **image-builder**: Independent, can be merged first
   - Implements build command functionality
   - No dependencies on other Wave 1 efforts

2. **gitea-client-split-001**: Independent from image-builder
   - Provides core registry infrastructure
   - Authentication and basic operations

3. **gitea-client-split-002**: Depends on split-001
   - âœ… **RESOLVED**: Now properly rebased onto the CURRENT split-001 (commit 4fb2931)
   - Enhances push/list operations from split-001
   - Adds retry logic and test improvements
   - Contains all split-001 fixes via cherry-picked commits

### Integration Status Update
âœ… **SIMPLIFIED**: gitea-client-split-002 has been successfully rebased onto the current split-001. The commit history is now LINEAR (phase1/integration â†’ split-001 â†’ split-002), eliminating the complex merge requirements.

## Merge Sequence

### Order of Operations
1. **First**: image-builder (independent, clean base)
2. **Second**: gitea-client-split-001 (rebased, clean)
3. **Third**: gitea-client-split-002 (simple merge - now properly based on split-001)

## Detailed Merge Instructions

### Pre-merge Setup
```bash
# 1. Navigate to integration directory
cd /home/vscode/workspaces/idpbuilder-oci-build-push/efforts/phase2/wave1/integration-workspace/repo

# 2. Ensure clean working directory
git status
# Expected: "nothing to commit, working tree clean"

# 3. Verify current branch
git branch --show-current
# Expected: "idpbuilder-oci-build-push/phase2/wave1/integration"

# 4. Fetch all remote branches
git fetch origin

# 5. Create backup tag before starting
git tag phase2-wave1-integration-backup-$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S)

# 6. Verify base is phase1/integration
git log --oneline -1
# Should show phase1/integration as base
```

### Merge 1: image-builder
```bash
# 1. Start merge
git merge origin/idpbuilder-oci-build-push/phase2/wave1/image-builder --no-ff \
  -m "merge: integrate image-builder effort into Phase 2 Wave 1"

# 2. Expected conflicts (if any)
# - demo-features.sh (likely different demo implementations)
# - work-log.md (different work histories)
# - DEMO-IMPLEMENTATION-COMPLETE.marker
# - DEMO.md, DEMO-RETROFIT-PLAN.md

# 3. Conflict resolution strategy
# For demo-features.sh: Keep both sets of demos, merge content
# For work-log.md: Append both histories chronologically
# For marker files: Keep all markers
# For DEMO files: Merge content, keeping all demonstrations

# 4. If conflicts occur:
# git status  # Check conflicted files
# [resolve conflicts manually]
# git add [resolved files]
# git commit --no-edit

# 5. Verify after merge
git diff HEAD~1 --stat
# Should show image-builder implementation files in pkg/build/

# 6. Test compilation
go build ./...
```

### Merge 2: gitea-client-split-001
```bash
# 1. Start merge
git merge origin/idpbuilder-oci-build-push/phase2/wave1/gitea-client-split-001 --no-ff \
  -m "merge: integrate gitea-client-split-001 into Phase 2 Wave 1"

# 2. Expected conflicts
# - demo-features.sh (both branches add demos)
# - work-log.md (both have different histories)
# - go.mod (potential dependency conflicts)
# - DEMO-related files (both efforts have demos)

# 3. Conflict resolution strategy
# For demo-features.sh:
#   - Create sections for image-builder and gitea-client demos
#   - Preserve all demo functionality
# For work-log.md:
#   - Append histories chronologically
#   - Keep all entries for audit trail
# For go.mod:
#   - Keep all dependencies
#   - Resolve version conflicts by taking latest version

# 4. If conflicts occur:
# git status
# [resolve conflicts]
# git add [resolved files]
# git commit --no-edit

# 5. Verify after merge
git diff HEAD~1 --stat
# Should show new files in pkg/registry/
# Should show auth.go, gitea.go, interface.go, etc.

# 6. Test compilation
go build ./...
go test ./pkg/registry/...
```

### Merge 3: gitea-client-split-002 (SIMPLE MERGE - Now Rebased!)
```bash
# 1. âœ… SIMPLIFIED: This merge is now straightforward
# Split-002 has been rebased onto the current split-001
# Linear history: phase1/integration â†’ split-001 â†’ split-002
# Conflicts should be minimal or non-existent

# 2. Start merge (expect clean or minimal conflicts)
git merge origin/idpbuilder-oci-build-push/phase2/wave1/gitea-client-split-002 --no-ff \
  -m "merge: integrate gitea-client-split-002 into Phase 2 Wave 1"

# 3. Expected conflicts (MINIMAL)
# Since split-002 now contains all split-001 commits:
# - Possibly demo-features.sh (if modified in multiple branches)
# - Possibly work-log.md (different histories)
# - Most code conflicts should be resolved by the rebase

# 4. Resolution strategy (if any conflicts)
# For demo-features.sh:
#   - Merge demo sections from all branches
#   - Keep all demo functionality
# For work-log.md:
#   - Append histories chronologically
#
# Code conflicts should be rare since split-002 includes split-001

# 5. If minimal conflicts occur:
git status  # Should show few if any conflicts
# [resolve any remaining conflicts]
git add [resolved files if any]
git commit --no-edit

# 6. Verify the merge
git diff HEAD~1 --stat
# Should show:
# - Enhanced push/list in pkg/registry/
# - New retry.go file
# - Mocks moved to test files (R320 compliance)
# - Additional test coverage from split-002

# 7. Test to confirm everything works
go build ./...
go test ./pkg/registry/... -v
```

## Conflict Resolution Guidelines

### General Principles
1. **Functionality First**: Ensure all implemented features are preserved
2. **No Duplication**: Remove duplicate implementations, especially from older bases
3. **Test Coverage**: Keep all test cases from all branches
4. **Demo Completeness**: Merge all demo scripts into organized sections
5. **R320 Compliance**: Ensure no stub implementations remain

### Specific File Strategies

#### demo-features.sh
```bash
# Merge strategy: Combine all demos with clear sections
# Structure:
echo "=== Image Builder Demos ==="
# [image-builder demo code]

echo "=== Gitea Registry Client Demos ==="
# [gitea-client demo code]

echo "=== Integration Demos ==="
# [combined functionality demos]
```

#### work-log.md
```bash
# Merge strategy: Chronological append
# Keep all entries for complete audit trail
# Format: newest entries at top or bottom (be consistent)
```

#### go.mod
```bash
# Merge strategy: Latest versions win
# After merge:
go mod tidy
# This will resolve any dependency conflicts
```

#### pkg/registry/* files
```bash
# Merge strategy for split conflicts:
# 1. split-001 provides base infrastructure (already merged)
# 2. split-002 provides enhancements
# 3. When the same function exists in both:
#    - Take split-002's version (more complete)
# 4. For new files in split-002 (like retry.go):
#    - Keep entirely
```

## Verification Steps

### After Each Merge
```bash
# 1. Compilation check
go build ./...

# 2. Test execution
go test ./... -v

# 3. Line count verification
PROJECT_ROOT=/home/vscode/workspaces/idpbuilder-oci-build-push
$PROJECT_ROOT/tools/line-counter.sh

# 4. Demo validation (if demos exist)
if [ -f demo-features.sh ]; then
  bash demo-features.sh
fi

# 5. Commit verification
git log --oneline -5
```

### Final Integration Verification
```bash
# 1. Full test suite with coverage
go test ./... -v -cover

# 2. Specific package tests
go test ./pkg/build/... -v     # image-builder
go test ./pkg/registry/... -v  # gitea-client

# 3. Size compliance check
$PROJECT_ROOT/tools/line-counter.sh
# Total should be reasonable for Wave 1

# 4. Check all branches are integrated
git log --oneline --graph -20
# Should show merge commits for all three branches

# 5. Verify no stub implementations (R320)
grep -r "panic.*not.*implemented" pkg/
grep -r "TODO.*implement" pkg/
# Should return no results

# 6. Push to remote
git push origin idpbuilder-oci-build-push/phase2/wave1/integration
```

## Rollback Procedures

### If Merge Fails
```bash
# 1. Abort current merge
git merge --abort

# 2. Reset to backup tag
git reset --hard phase2-wave1-integration-backup-[timestamp]

# 3. Investigate issue
git diff origin/[branch-name] --stat
git log origin/[branch-name] --oneline -10

# 4. Retry with adjusted strategy
```

### If Tests Fail After Merge
```bash
# 1. Identify failing tests
go test ./... -v 2>&1 | grep -E "FAIL|Error"

# 2. Check recent changes
git diff HEAD~1

# 3. Decision point:
# Option A: Fix issues in place
# [make fixes]
git add [fixed files]
git commit -m "fix: resolve test failures after merge"

# Option B: Revert if critical
git revert HEAD
```

## Expected Outcomes

### Success Criteria
âœ… All three branches merged successfully
âœ… No compilation errors
âœ… All tests passing
âœ… Demo scripts functional (if present)
âœ… Size within limits per effort
âœ… Clean git history with clear merge commits
âœ… No stub implementations (R320 compliance)

### Files Expected After Integration
```
pkg/
â”œâ”€â”€ build/           # Image builder implementation
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ builder.go
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ command.go
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ...
â”œâ”€â”€ registry/        # Complete Gitea registry client

```

## Risk Assessment

### âœ… UPDATED: Risk Level Reduced
1. **Split-002 merge**: ~~Based on older split-001, high conflict probability~~
   - **RESOLVED**: Now rebased on current split-001, LOW conflict probability
   - Expect straightforward, clean merge

2. **Registry functionality**: Split-002 properly extends split-001
   - Since split-002 now has all split-001 changes, no overlap issues
   - Test to confirm all functionality works together

3. **Test mock refactoring**: Split-002 moves mocks to comply with R320
   - This refactoring is clean and should merge without issues
   - Verify all tests still pass after merge

### Medium Risk Areas
1. **Demo script conflicts**: Multiple demo implementations
   - Mitigation: Organize into clear sections
   - Test each demo section independently

2. **Dependency versions**: Different go.mod requirements
   - Mitigation: Use go mod tidy to resolve
   - Test with final dependency set

## Notes for Orchestrator

âœ… **UPDATED GUIDANCE**:
1. This is a PLAN only - actual merge execution by orchestrator/integration agent
2. **Split-002 is now SIMPLE to merge** - properly rebased on split-001
3. Test after each merge to confirm functionality
4. Document the smooth integration in your report
5. The rebase has eliminated the need for complex manual merging
