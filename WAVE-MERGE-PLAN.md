## Efforts to Integrate

| Effort | Branch | Status | Lines | Ready |
|--------|--------|--------|-------|-------|
| P1W1-E1 | phase1/wave1/P1W1-E1-provider-interface | COMPLETE | 218 | ✅ |

| P1W1-E4 | phase1/wave1/P1W1-E4-cli-contracts | COMPLETE | 508 | ✅ |

## Pre-Integration Requirements

### ✅ All Requirements Met
- All effort implementations are committed and pushed
- P1W1-E2 was successfully committed at 16:58 (commit: 929bef9)
- All branches are available on origin
- Integration can proceed immediately

## Merge Order and Strategy

Based on the analysis of dependencies and to minimize conflicts, the recommended merge order is:

1. **P1W1-E1**: Provider Interface Definition (foundational, no dependencies)
2. **P1W1-E2**: OCI Package Format Specification (after fixing branch)
3. **P1W1-E3**: Registry Configuration Schema (independent)
4. **P1W1-E4**: CLI Interface Contracts (may depend on others)

## Detailed Merge Instructions

### Setup Integration Workspace
```bash
# Navigate to integration directory
cd /home/vscode/workspaces/idpbuilder-gitea-push/efforts/phase1/wave1/integration-workspace

# Ensure on integration branch
git checkout phase1-wave1-integration

# Verify clean state
git status

# Fetch latest changes
git fetch origin
```

### Merge E1: Provider Interface Definition
```bash
# Merge E1 into integration
git merge phase1/wave1/P1W1-E1-provider-interface --no-ff -m "feat(integration): Merge P1W1-E1 Provider Interface Definition

- Added Provider interface with Push/Pull/List/Delete operations
- Created 8 types for provider operations
- Implemented ProviderError with proper error handling
- Size: 218 implementation lines"

# Verify no conflicts
git status

# Run tests if available
if [ -f pkg/providers/types_test.go ]; then
    go test ./pkg/providers/...
fi
```

### Merge E2: OCI Package Format
```bash
# E2 is now ready for merge (committed at 16:58)
git merge phase1/wave1/P1W1-E2-oci-package-format --no-ff -m "feat(integration): Merge P1W1-E2 OCI Package Format Specification

- Added OCI package manifest and descriptor types
- Implemented manifest validation and serialization
- Created layer management functions
- Size: 218 implementation lines"

# Expected: No conflicts (independent package)
git status

# Run tests
if [ -f pkg/oci/format/manifest_test.go ]; then
    go test ./pkg/oci/format/...
fi
```

### Merge E3: Registry Configuration
```bash
# Merge E3
git merge phase1/wave1/P1W1-E3-registry-config --no-ff -m "feat(integration): Merge P1W1-E3 Registry Configuration Schema

- Added registry configuration management
- Implemented auth and TLS configuration
- Created configuration validation and merging
- Size: 395 implementation lines"

# Check for conflicts
git status

# If conflicts in go.mod or go.sum:
# - Keep all dependencies from both sides
# - Run: go mod tidy

# Run tests
if [ -f pkg/config/registry_test.go ]; then
    go test ./pkg/config/...
fi
```

### Merge E4: CLI Interface Contracts
```bash
# Merge E4 (last, as it may reference other packages)
git merge phase1/wave1/P1W1-E4-cli-contracts --no-ff -m "feat(integration): Merge P1W1-E4 CLI Interface Contracts

- Added CLI interface definitions for OCI operations
- Created registry management interfaces
- Implemented command option structures
- Size: 508 implementation lines"

# Potential conflicts in pkg/cmd area
git status

# Conflict resolution strategy:
# - If conflicts in pkg/cmd/interfaces: Keep both sets of interfaces
# - If conflicts in imports: Combine all imports
# - If conflicts in tests: Keep all tests

# Run tests
if [ -d pkg/cmd/interfaces ]; then
    go test ./pkg/cmd/interfaces/...
fi
```

## Post-Merge Validation

### 1. Size Verification
```bash
# Verify total size using line-counter tool
PROJECT_ROOT="/home/vscode/workspaces/idpbuilder-gitea-push"
$PROJECT_ROOT/tools/line-counter.sh

# Expected total: ~1339 lines (218+218+395+508)
# Must be under wave limit (typically 3000-4000 lines)
```

### 2. Build Verification
```bash
# Ensure everything compiles
go mod tidy
go build ./...

# Run all tests
go test ./pkg/...
```

### 3. Package Structure Verification
```bash
# Verify all packages are present
ls -la pkg/providers/    # From E1
ls -la pkg/oci/format/   # From E2
ls -la pkg/config/       # From E3
ls -la pkg/cmd/interfaces/ # From E4
```

### 4. Commit and Push Integration
```bash
# After all merges complete and validated
git push origin phase1-wave1-integration
```

## Expected Conflicts and Resolution

### Likely Conflict Points:
1. **go.mod/go.sum**: Multiple efforts may add dependencies
   - Resolution: Keep all unique dependencies, run `go mod tidy`

2. **pkg/cmd/**: E4 adds to existing cmd structure
   - Resolution: Preserve existing + add new interfaces subdirectory

3. **README or docs**: If multiple efforts update documentation
   - Resolution: Combine all documentation updates

### No Conflicts Expected In:
- pkg/providers/ (E1 - new directory)
- pkg/oci/format/ (E2 - new directory)
- pkg/config/ (E3 - likely new or minimal overlap)

## Rollback Strategy

If critical issues are encountered during merge:

```bash
# Save current state
git branch backup-integration-attempt-$(date +%s)

# Reset to pre-merge state
git reset --hard origin/phase1-wave1-integration

# Investigate issue and retry
```

## Success Criteria

Integration is complete when:
- ✅ All 4 efforts successfully merged
- ✅ No uncommitted changes remain
- ✅ All tests pass
- ✅ Total size under limits (verified with line-counter.sh)
- ✅ Integration branch pushed to remote
- ✅ Build succeeds without errors

## Notes for Integration Agent

1. **READY**: E2 branch is now committed and ready (fixed at 16:58)
2. Follow merge order exactly to minimize conflicts
3. Use `--no-ff` flag to preserve merge history
4. Document any unexpected conflicts encountered
5. Run validation after EACH merge, not just at end
6. If uncertain about conflict resolution, request clarification

## Integration Readiness Checklist

- [✅] E2 branch fixed and pushed (completed at 16:58, commit 929bef9)
- [ ] All effort branches fetched locally
- [ ] Integration branch is clean (no uncommitted changes)
- [ ] Line counter tool available at specified path
- [ ] Go development environment ready for testing
