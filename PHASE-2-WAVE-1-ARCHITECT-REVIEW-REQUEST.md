## Integration Results
- **Build**: PASSING (after fixes)
- **Tests**: PARTIAL
- **Demos**: INDIVIDUAL_PASS
- **Overall**: PARTIAL_SUCCESS

## Critical Issues for Review
1. **Size Violations**: 2 of 3 efforts exceed 800-line limit significantly
2. **Split Boundary Violation**: Split-001 itself needs splitting (unusual situation)
3. **Integration Despite Violations**: Integration proceeded with oversized efforts

## Questions for Architect
1. Should we proceed to Wave 2 with these size violations?
2. Should splits be implemented retroactively?
3. How to handle the split-of-split situation?
4. Overall wave quality assessment?

## Next Steps Decision Required
- PROCEED_NEXT_WAVE (accept violations)
- REQUIRE_SPLITS (block until compliant)
- OTHER_RECOMMENDATION
