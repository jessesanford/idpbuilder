## Security Assessment

### ✅ Credential Security (STRONG)
- **NO hardcoded credentials found** ✓
- Multiple secure credential sources
- Keyring integration for persistent storage
- Environment variable support for CI/CD
- Token-based authentication (not just passwords)

### ✅ Certificate Handling (PROPER)

## Issues Identified

### Priority 1 (NONE)
No critical issues that would block phase completion.

### Priority 2 (MINOR)
1. **Limited test coverage for registry operations**: Integration tests could be expanded
   - *Impact*: Low - unit tests provide adequate coverage
   - *Recommendation*: Add in Phase 3 if time permits

2. **Progress tracking granularity**: Could provide more detailed layer-by-layer progress
   - *Impact*: Low - current implementation is functional
   - *Recommendation*: Enhancement for future phases

### Priority 3 (ADVISORY)
1. **Documentation expansion**: Could add more detailed API documentation
2. **Example configurations**: Could provide sample config files
3. **Performance benchmarks**: Could add benchmark tests

## Phase Success Criteria
