# Fix Progress Tracker

## Tracking Information
- **Date Created**: 2025-09-05 22:35:00 UTC
- **State**: FIX_BUILD_ISSUES
- **Integration Branch**: phase2/wave2-integration-20250905-201315
- **Total Issues**: 2 format string errors

## Engineers Spawned
- [x] Engineer 1: Fix kindlogger.go format strings - Status: COMPLETED
  - Working Directory: /home/vscode/workspaces/idpbuilder-oci-go-cr/efforts/phase2/wave2/integration-workspace
  - Instructions File: FIX-INSTRUCTIONS-kindlogger.md
  - Task: Fix format string errors at lines 26 and 31
  - Commit Hash: 010aa4d

## Issues to Fix

### Format String Errors
- [x] pkg/kind/kindlogger.go:26 - `fmt.Errorf(message)` → `fmt.Errorf("%s", message)` - FIXED
- [x] pkg/kind/kindlogger.go:31 - `fmt.Errorf(msg)` → `fmt.Errorf("%s", msg)` - FIXED

## Fix Application Progress
- [x] SW Engineer spawned with fix instructions
- [x] Fixes applied to pkg/kind/kindlogger.go
- [x] Build command executed successfully (`go build ./pkg/kind`)
- [x] Test compilation verified (`go test -c ./pkg/kind`)
- [x] All tests pass (`go test ./pkg/kind/...`)
- [x] Fix commit created with clear message
- [x] Commit hash recorded: 010aa4d

## Verification Status
- [x] Main build completes without errors (pkg/kind specific)
- [x] Test compilation succeeds
- [x] No new errors introduced
- [x] All previously fixed issues remain resolved
- [x] Integration workspace fully buildable (pkg/kind specific)

## Backport Progress
- [ ] Origin effort identified for kindlogger.go
- [ ] Original branch name determined: _______________
- [ ] Backport plan documented in BACKPORT-MANIFEST.md
- [ ] Ready for backport execution

## Build Validation Results

### Before Fixes
- Main Build: ✅ SUCCESS
- Test Compilation: ❌ FAILED (2 format string errors)
- Binary Generation: ✅ SUCCESS

### After Fixes
- Main Build: ✅ SUCCESS (pkg/kind builds successfully)
- Test Compilation: ✅ SUCCESS (go test -c ./pkg/kind)
- Binary Generation: ✅ SUCCESS (go build ./pkg/kind)

## Timeline
- 22:22:00 - Build validation identified 2 format string errors
- 22:33:00 - Fix instructions created
- 22:34:00 - Backport manifest created
- 22:35:00 - Progress tracker created
- 22:39:44 - SW Engineer spawned
- 22:40:15 - Fixes applied to both format string errors
- 22:41:00 - Build validation passed (commit 010aa4d)
- 22:41:30 - Ready for next state

## Next State Decision
Once all fixes are verified:
- If clean build achieved → Transition to BUILD_VALIDATION for final verification
- If backports needed separately → Transition to BACKPORT_FIXES
- If issues remain → Stay in FIX_BUILD_ISSUES for additional fixes

## Notes
- These are straightforward format string fixes similar to previously resolved issues
- Pattern is consistent: Use `fmt.Errorf("%s", variable)` format
- Low risk changes that should not affect functionality
- Critical for build success and test compilation

## Blockers
- None currently identified

## Success Criteria
Before transitioning to next state:
- [x] All build errors analyzed
- [x] Fix instructions created for each issue
- [x] Engineers spawned for all fixes
- [x] Fixes verified to work
- [x] Complete backport manifest created
- [x] All changes committed and pushed
