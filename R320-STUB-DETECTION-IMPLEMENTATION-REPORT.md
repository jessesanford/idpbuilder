# R320 Stub Detection Implementation Report

## Executive Summary

Successfully implemented R320 - No Stub Implementations rule to address the critical process failure where stub implementations were passing code review.

## Problem Statement

From the transcript analysis, Code Reviewers were:
- Detecting stub implementations (e.g., "push command returns 'not yet implemented'")
- Classifying them as "Minor Issues" instead of CRITICAL BLOCKERS
- Still marking them as "properly implemented"
- Getting distracted by size limits and missing severity of stub implementations

This allowed non-functional code to pass review and potentially reach production.

## Root Causes Identified

1. **No explicit rule** making stub implementations CRITICAL BLOCKERS
2. **Code Reviewers focused on structure** over actual functionality
3. **Contradictory assessments allowed** ("properly implemented" + "not fully implemented")
4. **Size violations distracted** from functionality issues

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Created R320 Rule File
**Location**: `/rule-library/R320-no-stub-implementations.md`

**Key Requirements**:
- ANY stub implementation = CRITICAL BLOCKER
- Zero tolerance for "not implemented" returns
- Empty function bodies = FAILED REVIEW
- TODO placeholders = IMMEDIATE REJECTION

**Stub Detection Patterns**:
- Go: `return fmt.Errorf("not implemented")`, `panic("TODO")`
- Python: `raise NotImplementedError`, `pass # TODO`
- JavaScript/TypeScript: `throw new Error("Not implemented")`

**Grading Penalties**:
- -50% for passing ANY stub implementation
- -30% for classifying stub as "minor issue"
- -40% for marking stub code as "properly implemented"

### 2. Updated Code Reviewer State Rules

#### CODE_REVIEW State (`/agent-states/code-reviewer/CODE_REVIEW/rules.md`)
- Added R320 as first priority check before all other validations
- Added mandatory stub detection protocol
- Added stub detection functions with comprehensive pattern matching
- Updated review decision framework to prioritize stub detection

#### SPLIT_REVIEW State (`/agent-states/code-reviewer/SPLIT_REVIEW/rules.md`)
- Added R320 enforcement for split reviews
- Emphasized that stubs in splits = entire split fails

### 3. Updated Code Reviewer Agent Configuration
**Location**: `/.claude/agents/code-reviewer.md`

- Added R320 section as critical enforcement rule
- Provided concrete bash commands for stub detection
- Listed forbidden contradictory assessments
- Included grading penalties

### 4. Updated Rule Registry
**Location**: `/rule-library/RULE-REGISTRY.md`

- Added R320.0.0 to registry with BLOCKING criticality
- Positioned after R319 in numerical order
- Clear description: "ANY stub implementation = CRITICAL BLOCKER = FAILED REVIEW"

## Implementation Details

### Stub Detection Protocol

Code Reviewers must now:

1. **Search for common stub patterns** (first step in review)
2. **Verify actual implementation exists** (not just compilation)
3. **Classify all stubs as CRITICAL BLOCKERS** (never "minor")
4. **Fail entire review if any stub found** (zero tolerance)

### Contradictory Assessment Prevention

These combinations are now explicitly forbidden:
- "properly implemented" + "returns not implemented"
- "Minor issue" + "core functionality missing"
- "Code structure correct" + "panic(unimplemented)"

### Integration with Existing Rules

R320 integrates with:
- **R007**: Size limits don't excuse stub implementations
- **R031**: Mandatory code review must catch stubs
- **R220**: Atomic PRs need complete functionality

## Verification Steps

Code Reviewers can verify stub detection with:

```bash
# Go patterns
cd $EFFORT_DIR && grep -r "not.*implemented\|TODO\|unimplemented" --include="*.go"

# Python patterns
cd $EFFORT_DIR && grep -r "NotImplementedError\|pass.*#.*TODO" --include="*.py"

# JavaScript/TypeScript patterns
cd $EFFORT_DIR && grep -r "Not implemented\|TODO.*throw" --include="*.js" --include="*.ts"
```

## Expected Impact

1. **Immediate rejection** of stub implementations
2. **No more false positives** in code reviews
3. **Complete functionality** required before approval
4. **Clear severity classification** for incomplete code
5. **Reduced production incidents** from stub code

## Rollout Status

- Rule R320: ✅ Created and documented
- Code Reviewer states: ✅ Updated with R320 requirements
- Agent configuration: ✅ Updated with enforcement details
- Rule Registry: ✅ Updated with R320 entry
- Git status: ✅ Committed and pushed to main branch

## Follow-up Recommendations

1. **Training**: Ensure all Code Reviewers understand R320 requirements
2. **Monitoring**: Track stub detection rates in reviews
3. **Refinement**: Add language-specific patterns as discovered
4. **Automation**: Consider pre-commit hooks for stub detection
5. **Metrics**: Track reduction in stub-related production issues

## Conclusion

R320 successfully addresses the critical gap in the code review process. With zero tolerance for stub implementations and clear grading penalties, the Software Factory will now prevent non-functional code from passing review. This ensures all merged code provides actual working functionality, not just structural templates.
