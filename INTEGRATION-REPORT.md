# Image Builder Rebase Report - Phase 2 Wave 1

## Rebase Summary
- **Date**: 2025-09-14
- **Operation**: Rebase onto latest phase1/integration
- **Source Branch**: idpbuilder-oci-build-push/phase2/wave1/image-builder
- **Target Base**: origin/idpbuilder-oci-build-push/phase1/integration (commit: 2c39501)
- **Agent**: SW Engineer

## Rebase Context
The image-builder branch is being rebased from an old phase1/integration commit to the latest complete Phase 1 integration. This provides:
- Complete Phase 1 foundation (Wave 1 + Wave 2)
- All certificate handling capabilities
- Registry authentication and TLS trust
- Proper base for Phase 2 image building functionality

## Phase 2 Implementation Foundation
With the latest Phase 1 integration as base, image-builder effort can now build upon:
- Kind certificate extraction (E1.1.1)
- Registry TLS trust management (E1.1.2)
- Registry authentication types (E1.1.3)
- Certificate validation pipeline (E1.2.1)
- Fallback strategies (E1.2.2)

## Rebase Conflicts Resolved
During the rebase process, conflicts occurred in documentation files:
- WAVE-MERGE-PLAN.md: Resolved by keeping Phase 2 context
- work-log.md: Resolved by keeping image-builder rebase context
- INTEGRATION-REPORT.md: Resolved by creating Phase 2 context

## Next Steps
After successful rebase completion:
1. Force push the rebased branch to origin
2. Verify clean working directory
3. Confirm image-builder implementation still functions correctly with new base
4. Continue with Phase 2 development

## Expected Outcome
The rebased image-builder branch will have:
- Latest Phase 1 integration as foundation
- All image-builder implementation preserved
- Clean history showing the rebase operation
- Ready for continued Phase 2 development
