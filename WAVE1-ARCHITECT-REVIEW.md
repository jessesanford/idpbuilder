Wave: Phase 1, Wave 1 - Essential API Contracts

## Review Scope
- E1.1.1: Minimal Build Types
- E1.1.2: Builder Interface

## Architectural Assessment

### Design Quality
✅ **Clean separation of concerns**: Types and interfaces are properly separated
✅ **Minimal dependencies**: Only standard library used
✅ **Clear contracts**: BuildRequest/BuildResponse provide clear API boundaries
✅ **Interface design**: Builder interface is simple and focused

### Integration Readiness
✅ **Wave integration branch created**: phase1/wave1-integration
✅ **No conflicts**: Clean merges of both efforts
✅ **Types are reusable**: Ready for Wave 2 implementation
✅ **Interface is implementable**: Mock tests prove viability

### Technical Debt Assessment
✅ **No debt introduced**: Clean, minimal implementation
✅ **No shortcuts taken**: Proper structure from the start
✅ **Testing adequate**: 70%+ coverage achieved

### Alignment with Phase Goals
✅ **Foundation established**: Core types and interface ready
✅ **MVP focus maintained**: No feature creep detected
✅ **Size compliance**: Both efforts well under limits

## Decision: WAVE_PROCEED

## Recommendations for Wave 2
1. Ensure Buildah client wrapper implements the Builder interface correctly
2. Maintain the same clean separation pattern
3. Keep authentication helper isolated for reusability
4. Continue with incremental, testable implementations

## Notes
Wave 1 establishes a solid foundation. The types are minimal but complete, and the interface provides a clear contract for Wave 2 implementation. Ready to proceed with core libraries.
