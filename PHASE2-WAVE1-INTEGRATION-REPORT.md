## Work Log Tracking

Complete work log maintained in WAVE-2-INTEGRATION-WORK-LOG.md with:
- All commands executed
- Timestamps for each operation
- Conflict resolution steps
- Build and test results

## Upstream Bugs Found (R266 - NOT FIXED)

None identified during this integration. The duplicate TLSConfig issue was already fixed in the image-builder branch before merging.

## Recommendations

1. **Push Integration Branch**: Ready to push to remote for architect review
2. **Test Coverage**: Consider adding integration tests for combined features
3. **Documentation**: Update main README with Phase 2 Wave 1 features
4. **Next Steps**: Proceed with architect review before Phase 2 Wave 2

## Conclusion

Phase 2 Wave 1 integration completed successfully. All three branches (image-builder and both gitea-client splits) have been integrated onto the Phase 1 base. The integrated branch builds cleanly, demos execute successfully, and all R291/R330 gates have been passed.

The integration is ready for:
- Architect review
- Further testing
- Potential promotion to main branch
