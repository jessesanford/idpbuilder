# Phase 2 Integration Setup

## Overview
Phase 2 integration will combine both Wave 1 and Wave 2 integrations into a single Phase 2 branch.

## Current Status
- **Phase 2, Wave 1**: ✅ Integrated
  - Branch: `idpbuilder-oci-build-push/phase2/wave1/integration-20250914-185809`
  - Contains: image-builder, gitea-client-split-001, gitea-client-split-002

- **Phase 2, Wave 2**: ✅ Integrated
  - Branch: `idpbuilder-oci-build-push/phase2/wave2/integration-20250914-200305`
  - Contains: cli-commands (with build fix)

## Phase 2 Integration Plan
1. **Base Branch**: `main` (fresh start for phase integration)
2. **Merge Sequence**:
   - First: Wave 1 integration
   - Second: Wave 2 integration
3. **Expected Result**: Complete Phase 2 with all features

## Efforts Included
### From Wave 1:
- E2.1.1: image-builder (go-containerregistry implementation)
- E2.1.2: gitea-client (split into 2 parts for size)

### From Wave 2:
- E2.2.1: cli-commands (build and push commands)

## R308 Note
Phase integrations start fresh from `main`, not from the last wave. This ensures clean integration.

## Next Steps
1. Create Phase 2 integration infrastructure
2. Create merge plan (Code Reviewer)
3. Execute integration (Integration agent)
4. Verify R291 gates
5. Get architect review
