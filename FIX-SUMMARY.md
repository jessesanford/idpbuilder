# Integration State Rules Path Fixes Summary

## Date: 2025-09-05

## Issues Found and Fixed

### 1. Hardcoded Absolute Paths
All recently created integration phase state rules had hardcoded paths like:
- `/home/vscode/software-factory-template/...`

These have been replaced with:
- `$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/...` for rule references

### 2. Non-Existent Rule References
The following state files referenced rules that don't exist in the rule library:

#### PRODUCTION_READY_VALIDATION
- ❌ R273-production-ready-validation.md (doesn't exist)
- ❌ R274-test-execution.md (doesn't exist)
- ❌ R275-dependency-validation.md (doesn't exist)
- ✅ Replaced with general validation requirements section

#### BUILD_VALIDATION
- ❌ R277-build-validation.md (doesn't exist)
- ❌ R278-artifact-generation.md (doesn't exist)
- ✅ Replaced with general build requirements section

#### FIX_BUILD_ISSUES
- ❌ R300-engineers-execute-fixes.md (doesn't exist)
- ❌ R301-backport-tracking.md (doesn't exist)
- ✅ Referenced R151 (which exists) for orchestrator code restriction
- ✅ Added general backport requirements section

#### BACKPORT_FIXES
- ❌ R302-backport-to-original.md (doesn't exist)
- ❌ R303-backport-verification.md (doesn't exist)
- ✅ Replaced with general backport requirements section

#### PR_PLAN_CREATION
- ❌ R279-pr-plan-creation.md (doesn't exist)
- ❌ R280-never-merge-to-main.md (doesn't exist)
- ❌ R281-pr-dependency-order.md (doesn't exist)
- ✅ Replaced with general PR plan requirements section

## Files Modified

1. `/agent-states/orchestrator/PRODUCTION_READY_VALIDATION/rules.md`
   - Removed hardcoded paths
   - Removed references to non-existent rules R273-R275

2. `/agent-states/orchestrator/BUILD_VALIDATION/rules.md`
   - Removed hardcoded paths
   - Removed references to non-existent rules R277-R278

3. `/agent-states/orchestrator/FIX_BUILD_ISSUES/rules.md`
   - Fixed hardcoded paths to use $CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR
   - Replaced non-existent R300 with existing R151
   - Removed non-existent R301

4. `/agent-states/orchestrator/BACKPORT_FIXES/rules.md`
   - Removed hardcoded paths
   - Removed references to non-existent rules R302-R303

5. `/agent-states/orchestrator/PR_PLAN_CREATION/rules.md`
   - Removed hardcoded paths
   - Removed references to non-existent rules R279-R281

## Note on INTEGRATION_TESTING and CREATE_INTEGRATION_TESTING

These files were checked and found to already be using proper path conventions:
- ✅ CREATE_INTEGRATION_TESTING uses `$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR` correctly
- ✅ INTEGRATION_TESTING was already fixed in a previous update

## Impact

These changes ensure that:
1. **Orchestrators can work from any directory** - No hardcoded paths
2. **No broken rule references** - Only existing rules are referenced
3. **Project portability** - Uses environment variables appropriately
4. **Consistency** - All state files follow the same pattern

## Verification

To verify these fixes work:
```bash
# Check for remaining hardcoded paths
grep -r "/home/vscode" agent-states/orchestrator/*/rules.md

# Check for rule references that don't exist
for rule in R273 R274 R275 R277 R278 R279 R280 R281 R300 R301 R302 R303; do
  if ! ls rule-library/${rule}*.md 2>/dev/null; then
    grep -l "$rule" agent-states/orchestrator/*/rules.md 2>/dev/null
  fi
done
```

Both commands should return no results if all issues are fixed.
