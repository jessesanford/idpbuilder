# Work Log - Effort E1.2.2

## Effort Details
- **Phase**: 1 - MVP Core
- **Wave**: 2 - Core Libraries  
- **Effort**: 2 - Registry Client
- **Size Limit**: 800 lines
- **Branch**: phase1/wave2/effort2-registry-client

## Implementation Plan Reference
See: IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN.md

## Work Sessions

### Session 1: 2025-08-22 13:33:32 UTC
**Environment Verification**
- [x] Working directory correct: /home/vscode/workspaces/idpbuilder
- [x] Git branch correct: phase1/wave2/effort2-registry-client
- [x] Remote configured: Yes
- [x] Initial size: 0 lines

**Tasks Started**
- Registry Client Implementation per IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN.md
- Progress: Environment verified, baseline measurement done, implementing interface and types first
- Size after: 0 lines

**Issues Encountered**
- None - clean starting state

**Next Steps**
- ✅ Created pkg/registry directory structure  
- ✅ Implemented registry client interface
- ✅ Added configuration types following Wave 1 patterns
- ✅ Added TLS configuration utilities
- ✅ Added authentication methods (token/basic)
- ✅ Added core client implementation with retry logic
- ✅ Added comprehensive error handling
- ✅ Added basic unit tests for types and errors

**CRITICAL: SIZE LIMIT EXCEEDED**
- Current size: 877 lines (800 max allowed)
- Source code: 692 lines  
- Tests: 185 lines
- STATUS: STOPPED per IMPERATIVE-LINE-COUNT-RULE
- ACTION REQUIRED: Split protocol must be initiated

## Testing Log

### Unit Tests
- [ ] Created for registry client interface
- [ ] Created for authentication methods
- [ ] Created for TLS configuration
- [ ] Created for push operations
- [ ] Created for error handling
- [ ] All passing
- Coverage: {X}%

### Integration Tests
- [ ] Created for Gitea registry integration
- [ ] Created for end-to-end push workflow
- [ ] All passing
- Coverage: {Y}%

### Manual Testing
- [ ] Registry authentication works
- [ ] Image push operations succeed
- [ ] Self-signed certificate handling works
- [ ] Error messages are clear and helpful

## Size Tracking

| Checkpoint | Lines | Status | Action |
|------------|-------|--------|--------|
| Initial | 0 | ✅ OK | Continue |
| After interface + types | ~80 | ✅ OK | Continue |
| After client implementation | ~200 | ✅ OK | Continue |
| After auth + TLS | ~280 | ✅ OK | Continue |
| After push operations | ~350 | ✅ OK | Continue |
| After tests | ~400 | ✅ OK | Final review |
| Final | {final} | {status} | {action} |

## Review Preparation

### Self-Review Checklist
- [ ] Code follows project patterns from Wave 1
- [ ] Interface design matches builder patterns
- [ ] Configuration extends existing types properly
- [ ] Authentication never logs credentials
- [ ] TLS handling supports self-signed certificates
- [ ] Error messages are user-friendly
- [ ] Tests comprehensive with mocking
- [ ] Documentation updated for all exports
- [ ] No commented-out code
- [ ] No debug statements
- [ ] Size under 800 line limit
- [ ] Build passing
- [ ] Lint clean

### Known Issues
- None / {list any known issues}

### Review Notes
- Focus on registry integration patterns
- Verify TLS certificate handling
- Check authentication security
- Validate error handling completeness

## Completion Status

**Implementation**: PARTIALLY COMPLETE (core functionality done)
**Size Compliance**: ❌ 877 lines (EXCEEDS 800 limit)
**Tests**: PARTIAL (types and errors tested)
**Build**: PENDING  
**Ready for Review**: NO - REQUIRES SPLIT

## Handoff Notes
Registry client implementation should integrate seamlessly with existing build patterns from Wave 1. Pay special attention to:
- Gitea registry compatibility
- Self-signed certificate support for development
- Clean interface design for testing
- Comprehensive error handling for network issues
