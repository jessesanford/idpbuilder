./utilities/check-requirements.sh

# Install missing requirements (supports apt, brew, yum)
./utilities/install-requirements.sh

# Create /efforts directory (may require sudo)
sudo mkdir -p /efforts
sudo chown $USER:$USER /efforts
```

### Manual Installation

#### yq (YAML processor)
```bash
# macOS
brew install yq

# Linux (binary)
wget https://github.com/mikefarah/yq/releases/latest/download/yq_linux_amd64 -O /usr/local/bin/yq
chmod +x /usr/local/bin/yq

# Verify
yq --version
```

#### GitHub CLI
```bash
# macOS
brew install gh

# Ubuntu/Debian
curl -fsSL https://cli.github.com/packages/githubcli-archive-keyring.gpg | sudo dd of=/usr/share/keyrings/githubcli-archive-keyring.gpg
echo "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/githubcli-archive-keyring.gpg] https://cli.github.com/packages stable main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/github-cli.list > /dev/null
sudo apt update && sudo apt install gh

# Authenticate
gh auth login
```

### Docker Option

If you prefer a containerized environment with all dependencies pre-installed:

```bash
# Build and run with Docker Compose
docker-compose up -d
docker-compose exec software-factory bash

# Or build and run with Docker directly
docker build -t software-factory:2.0 .
docker run -it -v $(pwd):/workspace -v sf-efforts:/efforts software-factory:2.0

# Inside container, run setup
./setup.sh
```

The Docker image includes all required and optional tools:
- ‚úÖ All required tools (yq, git, jq, bash, curl, gh)
- ‚úÖ All optional tools (ripgrep, fd, tree, make)
- ‚úÖ Pre-configured /efforts directory
- ‚úÖ Non-root user with sudo access

## üöÄ Quick Start

Run the interactive setup script to create your own Software Factory 2.0 project:

```bash
# First, ensure all requirements are installed
./utilities/install-requirements.sh

# Then run setup
./setup.sh
```

The setup wizard will guide you through:
1. **Project Information** - Name, description, target directory
2. **Technology Stack** - Programming language and frameworks
3. **Agent Configuration** - Which agents you need and their expertise
4. **Implementation Planning** - Generate or provide your own plan
5. **Development Constraints** - Size limits, parallelization, security

## üìã What is Software Factory 2.0?

Software Factory 2.0 is an advanced AI agent orchestration system that manages complex software development projects through:

- **State Machine Driven Development** - Predictable, recoverable workflows
- **Multi-Agent Orchestration** - Specialized agents for different tasks
- **Automatic Size Management** - Never exceed line limits with automatic splitting
- **Context Recovery** - Survive interruptions and context loss
- **Grading System** - Performance metrics for continuous improvement
- **Pre-flight Checks** - Ensure correct environment before work begins

## ü§ñ Available Agents

### Orchestrator (Required)
- Manages overall workflow and state machine
- Spawns other agents based on current needs
- Tracks progress and manages integrations
- **Never writes code** - only coordinates

### Software Engineer
- Implements features according to plans
- Maintains work logs and Git hygiene
- Monitors size limits continuously
- Handles splits when needed

### Code Reviewer
- Creates implementation plans
- Reviews code for quality and compliance
- Plans splits for oversized efforts
- Validates test coverage

### Architect
- Reviews architectural integrity
- Assesses phase transitions
- Makes PROCEED/CHANGES_REQUIRED decisions
- Ensures system-wide consistency

## üéØ Key Features

### Pre-Flight Checks
Every agent starts with mandatory environment verification:
```yaml
‚úì Agent identity confirmation
‚úì Working directory verification  
‚úì Git branch validation
‚úì Remote tracking status
‚úì Rule acknowledgment
```

### Automatic Size Management
- Continuous monitoring every 200 lines
- Automatic split planning when approaching limits
- Sequential split execution
- Integration after successful splits

### Context Recovery
- PreCompact hook creates marker file automatically
- TODO preservation across sessions
- State machine checkpoint system
- Recovery assistant for interrupted work

### Grading System
Performance metrics tracked for:
- Parallel spawn timing (<5s requirement)
- Code review first-try success rate
- Integration success rate
- Size compliance rate

## üîß Configuration

### project-config.yaml
Created by setup script with your choices:
```yaml
project:
  name: "your-project"
  language: "Go"
  
technology_stack:
  - Kubernetes/KCP
  - gRPC
  
constraints:
  max_lines_per_effort: 800
  test_coverage_target: 80
```

### orchestrator-state.json
Tracks current progress:
```yaml
current_phase: 1
current_wave: 2
current_state: SPAWN_AGENTS

efforts_completed: [...]
efforts_in_progress: [...]
```

## üìö Available Commands

### Agent Commands
- `/continue-orchestrating` - Resume orchestration
- `/continue-implementing` - Resume implementation
- `/continue-reviewing` - Resume code review
- `/continue-architecting` - Resume architecture review

### System Commands
- `/check-status` - Comprehensive status check
- `/reset-state` - Reset state (3 safety levels)

## üö® Critical Rules

1. **Never exceed size limits** - Automatic enforcement at 800 lines
2. **Always maintain test coverage** - Configurable target (default 80%)
3. **Orchestrator never writes code** - Only coordinates
4. **Sequential split execution** - Never parallel splits
5. **Pre-flight checks mandatory** - Agents exit on wrong environment

## üõ†Ô∏è Customization

### Adding Custom Expertise
1. Add expertise modules to `expertise/`
2. Update agent configurations in `.claude/agents/`
3. Reference in `project-config.yaml`

### Custom Line Counter
For language-specific line counting:
```bash
cp tools/line-counter.sh tools/my-counter.sh
# Edit to exclude your language's generated files
```

### Custom Grading Metrics
Edit grading files in `agent-states/*/GRADING/grading.md`

## üÜò Troubleshooting

### Context Loss Recovery
1. Run `/check-status` to assess situation
2. Check `utilities/recovery-assistant.sh`
3. Load TODO state from `todos/`
4. Resume with appropriate `/continue-*` command

### Size Violations
1. Stop implementation immediately
2. Run line counter to verify
3. Plan splits with Code Reviewer
4. Execute splits sequentially

### Integration Conflicts
1. Architect reviews conflicts
2. Create resolution branch
3. Fix conflicts with SW Engineer
4. Re-run integration
